The reason why I became a vegan in the first place was my personal health. I was
not sick, but I felt my veins getting plugged with cholesterol and my metabolism
getting enriched with poison. And then, one day, I took the decision to stop. At
that point, I didn't know all the details. But I felt better day by day.

There were 800 significant studies about meat in 1015 already and it's well
known that animal protein is carcinogenic. The China Study (I also recommend the
book by T. Colin Campbell) is about a region in China where people were
coincidentally living vegan and could be examined in all areas of physiology.
The result was stunning. 80 - 90 % of all cancer and heart diseases and diabetes
cases can be avoided with a vegan diet.

So why don't we all live vegan then? This is where lobbyism comes in. For
generations, we are taught that milk is healthy and meat is needed to feed our
brains. Now meat production and pharmaceutics are unstoppable trillion dollar
industries.
