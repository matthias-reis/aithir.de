Now we know that we in Germany emit four and a half times more than we are
supposed to (539% of the budget). We also know that energy is the single most
important source of greenhouse gas emissions. But where do we lose that much
CO₂? Here are some case studies.

The primary energy consumption in 2020 was 143 GJ/Person\*a. The coal power
plant Niederaußem contributed about 0,7% to that energy but it uses up 22,2% of
our annual CO₂ Budget.

In comparison, an average gas turbine emits 670 g/kWh. In Germany, we consume 65
TWh/a through gas, which is 12,6%. This uses up 32,7% of our budget.

Another scenario: An average person needs 47,7 m² of living space in Germany. A
20-year-old house has a standard of 75 kWh/m²a. If you use gas, this equals an
emission of 2,3 t/a or almost 150% of the budget. Gigantic. If you live in a
passive house, you can reduce that to 30%.
