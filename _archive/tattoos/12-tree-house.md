"A warm welcome, Lucy", started the raven. The bird which was quite large even
for a raven looked into a gigantic book clad in leather with golden
applications. The front emblem showed a drawing of an insect, a cicada.

"Today is a special day, you know that right?", it continued in a lecturing
voice. "It's the day of the owl and you are the first who has come this far. But
first, I will invite you to my house".

The dark-feathered guy with cybernetic applications on its back made a gesture
with a wing and Lucy followed. Several trunks, branches, natural ladders and
climbs later, she saw the house.

It was even more beautiful than the rest of the scene, naturally, organically
fitting into the tree's structure and with stunning Art Deco architecture.

The front door was formed exactly like the logo on the book. It was a cicada.
Now she remembered that she observed the symbol everywhere along the way. On the
entrance door, the trunk, the battery pack of the caracal.

She entered.
