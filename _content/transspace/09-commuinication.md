Things that travel at the speed of light have the most benefit from the anatomy
of spacetime that the teams on the Enclave workshops had discovered. So FTL
communication was one of the first thriving engineering fields that emerged.

Even the G-Tubes useless for humans had been good enough to send probes, robots
and drones into transspace. The first series of transspace communication
phalanxes had settled at G171, which brought the moon into high-speed real-time
communication ranges of 8ms latency. And the delay for communication from Mars
went down to 3 seconds on average, good enough for live streams. The
communication in the whole solar system had changed completely after the first
generation.

Today all colonies are connected through a fourth-generation communication
system running on G180k. This renders a reaction time of 22 ms with the Titan
colony and 90 minutes with the science station in the Rana system about 30 Ly
away.
