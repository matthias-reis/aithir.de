Afraid of everything, but especially the lights that pointed to him, the demon
called Scrooge started to move inside the cage. The whole audience cried out a
noise of shock before they fell completely silent again. Everyone stared at the
leprechaun with an open mouth.

Only minutes earlier, they had heard the lecture of an apparently mad theologist
fantasising about the opened gates of hell and other oddities. And now their
eyes told them that it was true. Demons are back in the world.

This one was only one meter tall. Well, 70 centimeters if you don't count the
gigantic horns. It didn't look too dangerous and itself was full of fear. But
after hearing the first wild stories from the O'Clares, the scholars knew that
there were hordes of them and they get stronger and more brave every day.

Something had to be done. Hell on earth was not acceptable.
