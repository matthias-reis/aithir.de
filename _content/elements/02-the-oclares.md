Almost nobody in Juliettes clan remembers the time before the war and the
stories of the few remaining old people in the group sound like science fiction
every time they start telling them.

Juliette was 28. She was born three years before the entire world got wiped
out - by a virus, the elder said. But they don't know for sure or they don't
want to talk about it.

Her clan, the O'Clares are moving from town to town in Ireland to clean up, bury
the dead and live from the rich leftovers throughout the country. The clan
consists of sixty persons - many of them around her age. Five of the women,
however, were extremely valuable to the clan and the few remaining humans in the
whole world. They were pregnant. Juliette was one of them.

On the island, there are only some families in the north and a small community
around Trinity College in Dublin left. Overall not more than 1.800 Irish that
have survived. Finally united.
