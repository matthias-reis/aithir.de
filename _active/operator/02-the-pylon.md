The concert was awesome. But he went home in time. No more excursions into
after-concert clubs today. He lived in the left pylon. The pylons had been a
hotel project that didn't work out as expected. They were built into the remains
of the famous, huge KÃ¶hlbrand-Bridge in the harbour.

The project had been very ambitious - several storeys of an exclusive hotel
built into the two massive pylons and connected via gondolas. However, the
contractor company got bankrupt and left the construction site unfinished.

The squatter community was strong at that time and so the venue got inhabited
illegally. The infrastructure was excellent when you added some DIY efforts and
maintenance and nobody asked questions as long as the ownership was not clear.

Around 20 people lived on Hugo's side. But that day, he saw someone leaving
through the elevator, someone he didn't recognize. Suspicious. As he entered his
flat and noticed that he had been robbed, the shock was not as heavy as you
would expect.
