What? Developers are supposed to be replaced by AI? Never. I thought we'd be the
last?

But just like with the Designers, there is a viable product on the market. It's
called **Github Copilot**. It creates mostly usable code from the given context
of a file. It has learned through billions of lines of open-source code that is
hosted on the Github platform that dominates the market for code hosting.

It still makes mistakes. But it delivers stunning results and makes me as a
developer google much less. Think about its evolution. Let's say five years into
the future, it might be able to do all the tedious parts of coding for you - all
the boilerplate. And latest in ten years, you can tell the machine how a program
should work and there it is.

The world moves fast in that area. And with the new tech, it will accelerate
even more. But the high demand for developers will normalize and the time for
specialists will come (back).
