Some thoughts about May, 1st, the international labour day.

I think these days many things come together that describe the situation in the
world pretty precisely. Here are some examples.

Mastodon, the decentral network is a good start. Many people come here to flee
from Twitter. The reason is that the richest man in the world spends an
unbelievable amount of money to take over one of the most important
opinion-shaping networks. Alone the fact that this is possible is remarkable.

Furthermore, there are drastic price increases, that cause empty wallets for 90%
of the people. Many of these increases are purely caused by speculation. The
market reacts to fear, not to a real shortage. Only some speculators will
benefit.

Hourly, we see additional messages like that - like the 18-year-old boy that
inherits 3.3 billion Euros.

The gap between the rich and the poor is getting bigger every day.
