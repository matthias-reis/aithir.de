The concert hall was disappointing as usual, an old shabby place made out of
concrete and ugly steel bars in the middle of nowhere south of Hamburg. But
anyway Hugo loved live concerts. In the three-dimensional Mesh versions, you
could view from each angle, always experience perfect sound and see the
masterfully designed architecture of the venue. But the connection to the band
was missing.

These days you usually got two or three tickets to virtual concerts of the tour
together with your live ticket. Today, he went there alone. But his girlfriend
Adele and his colleague `R00t` (he didn't even know her real name) were there,
too. Both plugged in from home and connected through their immersives.

Hugo was a freelance operator and designer. He created and maintained places in
the Mesh, usually for companies. `R00t` was his developer. She was responsible
for the core software parts. They met each day. But they had never seen each
other in real life.
