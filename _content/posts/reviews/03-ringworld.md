I'm late to this sci-fi classic: Ringworld by Larry Niven. Niven has, especially
through the series of the Ringworld books, become one of the most renowned and
respected writers of the genre, often listed as a successor of Golden Age
authors like Bradbury, Asimov and Clarke.

Up to now, I have just read book one from the year 1970. There are eight more to
cover. But I'm not fully drawn into it - probably not yet. I really liked the
worldbuilding a lot, a full ring around a star. The description of the structure
and its implications is awesome. I also liked the Pratchet'esque back stories of
the alien races Niven used.

But in the end, the storyline couldn't hold up. It took too long to build up and
felt rushed at the end. I think it also tinkered too much with the dimensions
and distances.

I will surely continue reading, the other publications happened much later -
Ringworld Engineers, the second part came out in 1980. So I hope the dynamics
will be a bit better and more modern.
