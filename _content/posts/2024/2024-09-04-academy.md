There are dozens of fantasy fiction universes that spawned based on magic
schools and colleges. While it seems obvious that hermetics influenced
literature, as it did in so many other cases, you'd be wrong.

Hogwarts and the others have been created to process the traumas, the authors
had in their own school years. The Academic Council of the Hermetic Society on
the other hand gives you completely differnt vibes. There's nothing cozy about
it. But also nothing threatening, at least not for people with a decent set of
brain cells.

The Academy is a place of knowledge and facts. It's constituted with enough
power to be one of the pillars of the Society. Enough power to withstand
ideology. The Society survived ten thousand years, because it never gave in to
potential despots. Also among the Hermetics such figures appear from time to
time. And with Hermetic mind power, they're even hader to handle than their
normal world couterparts like Putin, Erdogan or Kim. But a strong and
independent science council is the best weapon against dogma.

The Academy continuously modernizes itself. Its fields of research spread and
grow with the times - latest additions in the areas of Internet and AI research
are good examples. But in some institutes, there's also a lot of dusty
tradition. The span of impressions goes from supercomputer workstations over
hyperclean white research rooms to auditoriums with old wooden benches.

But there's also a clear distance to the sicence of ordinary people. The Academy
only researches hermetic topics. While many physicists, psychologists or
microbiologists are hermetics, such fields were never a topic for the Academy.
