There are dozens of fantasy fiction universes that spawned based on magic
schools and colleges. While it seems obvious that the one influenced the other,
this is one of the few cases where you'd be wrong.

Hogwarts and theo others has been created to process the traumas, the authors
had in their own school years. The Academic Council of the Hermetic Society on
the other hand gives you completely differnt vibes. There's nothing cozy about
it. But also nothing threatening, at least not for people with a decent set of
brain cells.

The Academy is a place of knowledge and facts. It's built with enough power to
be one of the pillars of the society. Enough power to withstand ideology. The
society survived ten thousand years, because it never gave in to potential
despots. Also among the Hermetics such figures appear from time to time. And
with hermetic mind power, they're even hader to handle than their normal world
couterparts like Putin.

But a strong and independent science council is the best weapon against dogma.

The Academy continuously modernizes itself. Its fields of research spread and
grow with the times - latest additions in the fields of Internet and AI are good
examples. But in some institutes, there's also a lot of dusty tradition. The
span of impressions goes from supercomputer workstations over hyperclean white
research rooms to auditoriums with old wooden benches.

But there's also a clear distance to the sicence of ordinary people. The Academy
only researches hermetic topics. While many physicists, psychologists or
microbiologists are hermetics, such fields were never a topic for the Academy.
