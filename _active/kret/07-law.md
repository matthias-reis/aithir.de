The society of the Kret doesn't have a legislative power. As for all other parts
of their life, everyday rules are made within the family clans, the Arras.

Instead, they have a code of conduct, a rulebook that is over 5000 years old. It
is called "**Kanota Parchala**" and contains 1296 hard rules by which every Kret
citizen including the high members of the Karam Mas has to live.

The rules are continuously enforced by a caste of judges and therefore turn into
practical and modern interpretations.

There is also a second book, the "**Kanota Posa**", that describes the structure
of the Kret society and terms like property, ownership, heritage, consent and
decision making as well as the family structures.
