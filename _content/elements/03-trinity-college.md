Trinity College was one of the few remaining strongholds of civilisation. In
other regions they knew of, Ireland, England and Northern France, only a handful
of people were left. But here amongst the old walls of the campus, a stable
population of 1.000 people from baker to scholar had survived and organised a
decent life.

The big advantage of the community is that knowledge has survived. Practical
physics and technology were much needed these days next to classic crafts. They
are running a 24x7 radio station and a long range radio communication facility.

One of the recent experiments is to reconnect to one of the imaging satellites
that still circle earth to get a better understanding of what had happened. It's
been 25 years now since the war wiped out the world. They have an idea of those
events back then. But they still don't know much about the rest of the world.
Are they stranded on a lonely island or are they the rest of the civilisation?
