Of course, we also found more twists around the plain historic facts. The notes
of van Helsing showed many details and references to Mehmed II., the great
emperor. Vlad had been held hostage in the Ottoman Empire for his whole youth.
Some sources said he grew up together with Mehmed and his siblings. Others said,
he just heard about them in his cruel prison.

In any case, Vlad held a grudge against Mehmed II., a grudge so huge that he
impaled Mehmeds envoys and entourage in the Walachia and attacked Ottoman
territories in Bulgaria. This included the slaughter, that we expected from him
in the meantime.

Anyway, back to the Novel. Vlad formed his cult from the time when he escaped
the prison of his youth and grew it bigger and bigger throughout and after his
countless battles. And that is the fabric, that Bram Stoker's book is made of.

The case was now crystal clear to me. Just in time for the hermetic court.
