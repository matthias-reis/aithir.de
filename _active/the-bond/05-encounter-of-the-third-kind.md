The endeavour with the first twins was a fifty per cent success. Probe number
one brought amazing results from our nearest neighbour, Alpha Centauri. But the
probe to Barnards Star had a series of failures in its transmission module and
didn't deliver results.

Marie, in the meantime CFO of the company she had invested for, anyway reached
her goal. For her, it was the start of an exclusive holiday and migration
business. Time to build hotels on Proxima Centauri 3.

The Twins project and Marie's investments were not finished. Every six months,
Zodiac was ready with another pair of probes and sent them on their way to the
stars in our neighbourhood. Twenty destinations within five years and almost
each of them with financial success. Some companies profited from mining, others
started terraforming and creating settlements. Dozens of groups of people wanted
to start a new way of living.

In the sixth year, however, one of the probes reported the discovery of
intelligent life.
