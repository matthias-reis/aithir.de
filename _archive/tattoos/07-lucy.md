Lucy is a designer and design connaisseur. Others would say that she's an
influencer because, besides her job, she maintains a travel blog. Not for the
wonders of the real world. She's travelling the Mesh.

Her travelling avatar is special, too. She has designed it herself from scratch,
which is very unusual these days. When travelling, she is a cyborg mixing
cybernetic applications with human body parts. Her face is alomst her real one
though.

In the vast deeps of the mesh, you'll find a lot of famous architectural
masterpieces and 3d worlds to dive into and get lost in. But today, it's finally
time to visit **Prunus Digitalis**, the tree of digital life. It's just a cherry
tree, but it is supposed to have thousands of easter eggs to discover.
Especially today.
