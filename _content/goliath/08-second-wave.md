Another week later, about a month after the aliens arrived, they came back. This
time, much more cameras eyed any possible corner of public space. Humanity
captured 48 of the 61 spheres. But, what's more important, some of them kept
their focus. So we saw the activity.

We saw the spheres hovering about four meters above the ground. We saw metallic
shapes exiting the bottom of these spheres. We saw them moving around so swift
that we could only see them in the high-speed cameras.

And we were shocked to see how they pulled people into their ships. Again. But
this time, they seemed to be better informed. They had made a selection. Among
the kidnapped were 41 government members or high officials from 35 countries, 52
scientists from all disciplines and 29 leaders and strategists from leading
companies all over the world.

From that point on, one of the reporters claimed, the aliens knew us.
