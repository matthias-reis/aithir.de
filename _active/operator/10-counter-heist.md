`B055` moved like a robot. This was his world, the crunch time. Twenty seconds
left on the clock. The time was counting down in his heads-up display. For some
of the data artefacts, he used ejectors to transfer the raw data. But some of
them had to be extracted as a whole, the complete virtual objects. The problem:
This would be discovered within minutes by the securities at Credit Cayman.

In parallel `R00t` therefore had to take care of covering their traces. She
scrambled transmissions and dynamically switched VPN chains. And on top, she
planted evidence, their counter heist. It would be a digital bomb that was
supposed to detonate six hours later. She placed data packages, that contained
backtraces to their imposed clients. A risky manoeuvre. That's why she didn't
tell `B055`.

Five seconds left.

"Allright, let's go", he said and finished the last step. Then they activated
Houdini, the Software that made Avatars disappear.
