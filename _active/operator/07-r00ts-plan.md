`B055` once showed her the place in the 3D map of Prague. "I'd go there", he
said pointing at the ugliest piece of brutalism architecture that her otherwise
beautiful home city had to offer. It was the abandoned, rotten TV tower. Now she
came here to think from time to time. And there was a lot to process now.

She thought of the heist. Why them? How should they do it? She also had to think
of beautiful Adele. Was she safe? And she had to think of `B055`, who was no
boss at all. She found out his real name, Hugo Niemann. Well, it didn't make
things less complicated in her head.

"Focus", she thought while sitting in the wind on a concrete plateau 100m above
the red roofs. She went through the heist, every step, looked up things through
her AR, created small programs, helper d√¶mons and illegal bridges to quantum
computing arrays.

Then she saw it in the virtual blueprints. She found their way out. Now there
was one question left: Should she tell `B055`?
