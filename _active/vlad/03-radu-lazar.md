I was hoping to stay overnight in Schäßburg before my planned visit. But the
coach, the road holes and the weather disrupted the plans. Totally exhausted, I
came to the huge wooden door in one of the city wall towers, the tailor's tower,
and knocked using the heavy iron ring decorated with a wolf's head.

I sensed quite some hermetic power as someone approached the entrance from the
inside. The heavy door opened slowly and with the appropriate sound. The
administrator was smaller and younger than I expected, a scraggy little guy with
goggles on his nose.

"Who is this?", he asked in a voice that told me that he probably hadn't talked
for weeks.

"My name is Camil Constantin", I said. "I believe we have an appointment."

"Ah, yes, yes. I have expected you yesterday. I hope everything is fine. Please
come in!"

"Yes, I'm glad to be here now", I answered while I stepped into the dark and low
entrance hall. I had to duck and watch my head.
