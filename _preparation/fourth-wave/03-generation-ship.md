The Sagittarius Foundation was successful. Much earlier than expected, in the
year 2730, a huge starship was ready to set lightsail towards Alpha Centauri.

The vessel was gigantic. There was space for an initial population of 50.000
young people and 10.000 specialists of all ages and knowledge. A small, fully
working society.

The ship could reach 8% of the speed of light. The journey included an
acceleration, a drift and a deceleration phase and was supposed to take 50 years
in total. The boarding generation would already reach their retirement age when
they arrived at their destination. And another or even a third generation was
supposed to be born on the ship along the way.

Except for some minor technical issues, the mission was a success and reached
our neighbor star system in the year 2784. But Earth, the home planet would hear
news about it not before 2788 and celebrated with a huge worldwide event.
