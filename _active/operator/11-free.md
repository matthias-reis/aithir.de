`B055` and `R00t` needed over three hours in their virtual lab to sort out and
prepare the loot from the heist. Some of the data packets contained encrypted
inclusions they had to crack first. Some others were still covered in their
virtual objects. Paranoid shit.

But finally, they could put their delivery together. They had no idea what it
was. The data didn't make any sense to them. It was no crypto money. That's the
only thing they knew. Finally, `B055` pushed the button and sent off the data to
the vault the kidnappers gave them.

Time was ticking while they waited. `R00t`s virtual bomb that placed the
evidence was time-based and supposed to detonate in some minutes. After that,
they might have had another hour until the bank got hold of their kidnappers.
She permanently looked at the countdown on her watch. Time passed. The bomb went
off.

A minute later, `B055` received a simple message with a green checkmark emoji
from an unknown number. Five minutes later, he heard from Adele.
