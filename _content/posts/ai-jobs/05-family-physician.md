Doctors are highly qualified. But 90 % of the work our family physicians do
could also be done by an expert system. Their system uses comparably simple
algorithms based on a comparably large data set. It is a process that involves
matching symptoms, deciding and taking more detailed measurements, and finally
determining the right treatment.

All of that can be done by computers. Modern smart-watches have the ability to
measure most of the body parameters in permanent surveillance. They create more
precise insights than a doctor could ever achieve. Their advantage: objectivity.
They measure activity and effect at the same time and don't rely on vague
descriptions of the patient.

As these tools make progress every year. With AI, they can determine the risk of
a stroke much faster and even find traces of cancer years earlier than now.

For doctors that means 80% fewer cases. Only the complex ones are remaining. So
also the role of practices will change.
