## The Start

Although this styoryline is not fiction at all, it's anyway about the future.
What do we have to do to have a future? How can we save a planet? Do we have to
re-invent the world? Is it a re-birth, the second incarnation of world, **world
2**, so to say. Or is it actually not that complicated?

So it's all about the Seldon'esque crisis we're facing at the moment, **the
climate catastrophe**. I'd especially like to go into three different streams:

- **Transport**: Even besides its damage potential to the world climate (and
  this includes traditional cars and EVs), owning and driving so many cars harms
  us in many other ways. So it's worth a look on its own.

- **Diet and agriculture**: Food and food production are one of the big columns
  of reasons for the climate crisis. Everyone knows that. But it's also the
  hardest to give up.

- **Energy production**: Another topic with hundreds of side effects. We wage
  wars and fraternize with despots to get resources to produce energy. And we're
  ahead of another round of exploitation of the African continent.

## Energy

For transport and agriculture, I have created separate storylines. The pure
basics of energy production, consumption and management is the part that this
storyline will focus on. So let's dive in.

Energy, on the one hand, is by far the biggest driver of the climate crisis. On
the other hand, the region of central Europe faces another crisis fired by heat
and drought and by the war in Ukraine and our dependency on Russian gas and oil.

Our energy demand spreads into four more or less distinct sectors:

- electricity (43%)
- industrial consumption (24%)
- traffic (21%)
- heating (12%)

More detailed numbers with sources will follow. The whole climate crisis is much
more complex than only turning energy management into its green alternatives. It
entails other more efficient greenhouse gases than CO₂, deforestation and
tipping points.

## The Problem Chain

Even if you touch the surface of the building blocks of this topic, you already
see that any of these fields is utterly complex and never black and white. So
before I go into more detail on each of them, let's go back to the basic
problem.

Earth thankfully has a greenhouse effect. It would be a cold dead place of -18°C
if it wasn't there. This effect is caused by gases in the atmosphere that are
transparent in visual light and opaque in infrared light. Mainly water vapour
(with short term effects) and CO₂ (with complex long-term lifecycles).

We have increased the amount of CO₂ dramatically in the last 100 years - from
320 to 420 (by 30%) in the last 60 years alone. We have seen that Earth is
significantly heating up. The CO₂ pollution is caused by burning fossile fuels -
like coal (C) or gas (CH4).

We use the energy coming from there for global wealth, so we can't just stop it
without losing this wealth.

## Dimensions

A problem that I have with the climate catastrophe lies in the magnitudes of
numbers. When someone says "this emits 5 kg of CO₂ equivalent", what does that
mean? It's totally abstract.

So I think, we should make it more concrete and comparable. When the
[IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/), the main organisation that tracks climate change,
released their reports, they came up with a budget that we have if we want to
stay below the 1.5°C. It's **420 billion tons**. This is the amount we can emit
until the wold heats up by 1,5 degrees. We want to spread this budget
until 2050.

> > > Visualisation

That was the catchy and easy to remember claim on the Paris climate agreement
(closed on December 12th, 2015). **1,5 degrees until 2050**. This also means
zero - carbon neutral - after 2050.

Divided by 30 and the average expected population of 8,73 billion people, this
makes 1,6 tons per year for every one of us. This is my new reference.

What we actually emit:

- Germany: **539%**
- China: **536%** (astonishing, right?)
- USA: **1091%** (That is ten times the budget or: per year ten years of budget.
  The USA have used up their budget for 2050 in the year 2021 already.)
- World average: **400%**

In comparison:

- the german forest absorbs (`-`, that is a CO₂ sink) **-46,4%**
- Flight Hamburg - Malaga (Spain) **48,1%** (by train: **4,9%**)
- Flight Hamburg - Sydney **675%**
- Niederaußem (one single lignite power plant) **12,5%** (per German citizen)

## Energy Sources

Now we know that we in Germany emit four and a half times more than we are
supposed to (539% of the budget). We also know that energy is the single most
important source of greenhouse gas emissions. But where do we lose that much
CO₂? Here are some case studies.

The primary energy consumption in 2020 was 143 GJ/Person\*a. The coal power
plant Niederaußem contributed about 0,7% to that energy but it uses up 22,2% of
our annual CO₂ Budget.

In comparison, an average gas turbine emits 670 g/kWh. In Germany, we consume 65
TWh/a through gas, which is 12,6%. This uses up 32,7% of our budget.

Another scenario: An average person needs 47,7 m² of living space in Germany. A
20-year-old house has a standard of 75 kWh/m²a. If you use gas, this equals an
emission of 2,3 t/a or almost 150% of the budget. Gigantic. If you live in a
passive house, you can reduce that to 30%.

## How Much Do We Have to Save?

We know now that we're overshooting more than five times. But also the budget is
gone by 2050. At that point, we are not supposed to emit anything anymore. What
is left is what the trees, moors and oceans absorb.

Numbers say that about 1,9 Gt go into vegetation and 2,9 Gt are absorbed by the
oceans. That's 4,8 Gt or 34% of our current budget. So we have to reduce our
emissions from 539% to 34%.

It all boils down to three steps:

- **Electrification**: The main energy comes from electricity (e.g. electric
  cars or heat pumps for heating your living room). Exception: the heavy
  industry will need green hydrogen for their high energy density demand.
- **Green Electricity**: When all power comes from electricity, this must of
  course turn carbon neutral. Coal and gas must be replaced by wind, solar,
  biomass and water.
- **Saving Energy**: Who would have guessed that infinite growth is not
  sustainable? But there's also good news. Electric cars for example are much
  more efficient than combustion engines.

## Heating

We seem to have usable solutions for electricity and transport, as it seems. But
the third column, heating your living room, seems to be the biggest challenge
for carbon neutrality. There are a lot of buildings with a lot of shitty
technology built in. So the problem is highly decentral.

The heating sector contributes 15% to greenhouse emissions. That translates to
75% of our budget. At the moment, the share of energy sources is

- 41 % gas
- 17% oil
- 18% electricity
- 8% district heating
- 15% renewable energy

This sums up to about 70% of fossile energy sources. The renewable part mainly
comes from wood, which also doesn't scale well.

There are alternatives. Geothermal heat pumps will have to be introduced
wherever possible and heat exchangers must become standard.

The current technology is based on water as a carrier, which makes it difficult
to exchange it with more intelligent air conditioning systems. The major
turnover though must come through savings and better insulation.

## Coal

I had to change my publishing schedule a bit for a pressing topic: Coal! Coal is
currently the dirtiest of all energy sources. Therefore it's obvious that so
many people fight against sacrificing whole villages like Lützerath for lignite
open-cast mining.

So I researched some figures. Germany is worldwide number one in lignite
mining - in absolute numbers, not per capita - 10% more than number two, China.
In 2018, an equivalent of 500 Million t CO₂ or expressed in
[energy budget](/storylines/world-2/04-dimensions) 404% (yes, that is four times
the annual budget for coal alone). But a part of it is also exported and
consumed by people outside Germany. If we spread the coal throughout all of the
European population, it would still be 75% of a persons budget.

To make it even more tangible: Every single year more in that technology, costs
us 2 years of budget before 2050. Firing with full power till 2030 therefore
means being fully carbon neutral 14 years earlier. That is 2036. Very realistic,
right?

## Savings in the Heating Sector

I was already diving into the huge black hole of the heating sector and its
problems to go climate neutral. In fact, it's not solvable by only exchanging
technologies. We have to save energy.

Saving energy in heating does not mean, we have to live in the cold from now on
and everyone whose livingroom has more than 19 degrees is a climate change
denier. No. Savings can come from better insulations.

At the moment, the range is wide. While a typical old building needs 250
kWh/m²a, a passive house usually uses a tenth of it (less than 25 kWh/m²a).
Regulations of 1995 still allowed around 200.

But insulation measures have a problem. The physics is pretty fragile. If you
insulate only one part (e.g. better windows) or if you do it wrong (e.g.
insulate on the inside of the wall), mould is coming. So DIY is ruled out and a
heavy investment is needed.

There is an obligation to renovate in Germany and these laws are likely to be
tightened in the future. But the sector will remain the slowest.

## The End of the World (As We Know It)

It's done. I have finished my series of posts about climate change. I spawned
three Storylines. This one about [Energy as a whole](/storylines/world-2), one
about [traffic](/storylines/traffic) and a [vegan series](/storylines/vegan).
I've found out a lot along the way. But it's not enough.

This "not enough" has two sides. What we're doing right now is by far **not
enough**. Humans are short-sighted. The profit now is still more important than
the loss in ten years. We are so far behind that we can only hope to end with 2
degrees more temperature.

The second side is knowledge. The problem is utterly complex. Tipping points
here, synergies there. So a bunch of small posts are **not enough** to get a
grasp on the topic. Although everyone should know. Knowledge is the key to
solving the problem.

I'll try to continue to reduce it to small bits. This series is over, but I will
come up with new material.

Let's see if we continue to steer towards the end of the world or if we find a
proper navigation device to turn around.
