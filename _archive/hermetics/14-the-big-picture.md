In modern times, visualize everything after the stone age, humans follow five
motivations. Love and its antipode hate, wisdom, striving for power and
ambition. The last two are not the same. For some extreme examples, Einstein had
wisdom and ambition while Hitler strived for power and hate. You might think of
money as another motivator. These days, it is a means for power.

Mana is the sixth substance in this game. So it does not play the major role in
the world. But it combines well with any of the other motivators. Therefore the
most gifted Hermetics are not always the most influential ones.

But especially the most gifted Hermetics can see balance in nature. Talents and
motivators are spread evenly. Mana is spread evenly and without any preference.
This balance is not as fragile as we might think. Many of those gifted Magicians
can see the big picture and the connections behind it and especially its power
to heal.
