I just want to give you some relation between nature and livestock.

- 4% of mammal-related biomass is bound to **wild animals**.

- 36% are **humans**. We outweigh the rest of the animals by a factor of nine.

- 60% is **livestock**. The farming animals that we use as food.

The biggest part there is **cattle**, which by coincidence is also a large
source of methane and therefore plays a huge role in the greenhouse effect.

Another overall side effect is that we use more and more land for farming, i.e
growing soy for feeding the animals and grazing itself. This devastatingly
affects the planet's biodiversity. It also shrinks the rainforest (e.g. in
Brazil), which approaches a tipping point if it's getting reduced by another
18%. At that point, it can't maintain its microclimate anymore and will dry out.
