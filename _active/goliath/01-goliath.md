I'd like to dive into another new scenario. A new setting for a short story,
that will come in chunks of 1000 characters at a time.

Goliath is an AI program that is funded by several European states, the US and
Canada. And it is led by three major IT companies. Its goal is to create an AI,
that has general intelligence. This is intelligence in all relevant fields that
is equal to or exceeds the actual human level.

The project had to be kept fully under control at any time to avoid an
uncontrolled state. That's why the initiators had decided to build the
development complex in a region far away from civilization and completely
decoupled from the internet or other next to infinite data resources.

**They chose the Faroe islands.**

The developer crew was separated into two factions. The creators assembled and
maintained the hardware and software, while the trainers fed the beast with
carefully chosen information from history, science, daily news and other fields.
