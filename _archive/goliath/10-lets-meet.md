Two weeks after the aliens started to kill one by one, the whole humanity was in
despair. The count was only at 50.000 but the fact that we couldn't do anything
was causing serious panic in all of the other 7 billion people on earth.

Except for really heavy bombs, the military tried literally everything to at
least harm these beasts. But bombs caused too much collateral damage to try.

The decision of the world leaders was unanimous to play one more card they had
in their hands. The trainers of Goliath were supposed to involve the AI. They
presented all the footage they had, from video material to scientific papers
regarding the alien armour and movement strategies.

Goliath needed some time to process and came up with an answer some hours later
in the following session.

"I don't have enough information", it said. "I have to meet the enemy in person.
Please set me free."
