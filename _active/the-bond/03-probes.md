Fifty years later, the solar system was split between huge corporations with
more financial power than any state on earth. The Dublin drive, invented by
Zodiac, was the dominant spaceship technology. So the company became number two,
so huge that it could buy number three, Sagittarius. But the possibilities to
grow didn't end there.

After Marla Lay, Chi Feng became chairman. He came up with the idea to put his
claim on other star systems. He was a diplomat and cultivated good relations
with the other Megacorps and managed to form a consortium with five of his
competitors. Their project: sending discovery drones into the universe.

Already two years later, the first pair of drones launched from the facilities
at Zodiac station. Project Gemini started to Alpha Centauri and Barnard's Star.
The drones were built to find habitable planets and valuable asteroids and acted
as communication phalanxes for the probes they carried in their bodies.
