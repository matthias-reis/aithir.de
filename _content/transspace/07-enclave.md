Transspace - Project Enclave

By the year 2095, Marla Lays theory was complete and confirmed correct, but the
practical implications as well as the potential to change the world was either
unknown or mere speculation.

One year later, Lay with her good reputation and massive network could convince
seven other leading physicists and three engineers of a two-year project called
"Enclave".

Together with 50 other doctoral candidates and technicians, they founded a
science think tank in Noordwijk, Netherlands, which provided infrastructure for
both theoretical context and practical construction and experimentation.

They kept their discoveries close until the designated end in the year 2098,
thus the project title Enclave.

The result was a working, faster than light propulsion model, the so-called
Grava drive that could project the first artificial force field and a science
paper that was considered the seed of all later inventions.
