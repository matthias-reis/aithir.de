It was the darkest grey I've ever seen in clouds and we steered directly into
them. It already started to rain. And the wind got stronger every minute. I had
good clothing that kept my skin dry, but after some minutes, I couldn't stand it
anymore and had to go inside. Thirty more minutes and half of the crew,
experienced seamen, had to puke because of their sea sickness.

But it still got worse. It was around noon and through one of the portholes, I
saw the pure darkness in the sky and the rain walls hitting the glass.

We couldn't do anything. We sent out the SOS signal at one o'clock. Then we had
to wait. But it still got worse. We had lost some containers already, but then
the ship started to capsize and we faced death.

The first man, one of the Kazakhs, went overboard at around one thirty. Two more
lost their balance trying to save the poor man. Ten minutes later the ship
started to crack. I fell into the water and fainted.
