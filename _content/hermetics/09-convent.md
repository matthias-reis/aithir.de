Once a year, representatives of the lodges meet for several days and discuss the
state of the Hermetic Society. The Convent has been organised for around 8.000
years. In the beginning, it was a massive once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage for
attendees and only a small selection could follow the calls to the table. At
that time, the lodges had endless power.

When travelling became easier, more magicians from different parts of the world
could join. Today, the convent is like a gigantic fair with a lot of meet and
greet. There are so many Hermetics, that the lodges can only send some
representatives.

The Convent is well organized and forms several committees that discuss matters
from world politics to internal organisation.

Additionally, there are three central committees called councils that are
constituted through the convent but form permanent institutions: the Academic
Council or Academy, the Council of Observers and the Registry.
