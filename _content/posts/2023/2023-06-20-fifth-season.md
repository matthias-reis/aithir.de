One of the most famous SciFi authors, Arthur C. Clark, once said: "Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." This
characterizes the novel I'd like to discuss today pretty well. Let's talk about
"The Fifth Season".

As literally every SF enthusiast I know plus every blog and Booktok account
recommended it, I had to give it a read. "The Fifth Season" delivered what
everyone promised. It is what I call a genre-bender. Is it SciFi, is it Fantasy?
If you're a hardcore fan of one of the two, this book might not be for you. It
has magical elements, but it plays in a distant future. So perhaps according to
Clarke the magic is just a sufficient advancement of the human race.

N.K. (or Nora Keita) Jemisin is one of the POC, feminist writers who produce so
much great output - starting with Octavia E. Butler or lately Nnedi Okorafor.
But with the merits of several Nebula and Hugo awards, Jemisin is not only in
good company but also a leading member.

Back to the novel. If you like both SciFi and well-written fantasy, if dystopian
end-time stories are your thing and engaging character development is a must,
then read this novel. I will surely continue with the "Broken Earth" series,
which comes in three parts.
