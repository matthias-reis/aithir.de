We've seen that there are options to overcome the design flaws of cars. But by
far the most advanced infrastructure these days is the public transport sector.
Trains, subways and busses. However, it only ranks at number four after cars,
walking and bikes. The car is used 3 ½ times more often.

Even powered by fossil fuels, busses emit less than 50% of CO₂-equiv than a car.
Trains and subrways are already powered by electricity without the drawback of
unsustainable batteries. And this system transports biillions of people to their
destination every day.

But it has drawbacks, too. First of all, it is a central system and thus does
not scale well. Additional waves of passengers are stressing the already
exhausted system. As a central system, it is also unflexible. Delays cause
ripple effects throughout all its cog wheels, which results in delays. This
causes the feeling of unreliability and discomfort, which might be the reason
why the personally owned car still gets more adoption.
