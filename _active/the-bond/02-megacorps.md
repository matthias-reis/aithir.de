Later on, Marla became more famous than Einstein, but not only because of her
groundbreaking papers that changed physics. After that, she organized the think
tank "Enclave" and gathered the most brilliant minds for years to deepen her
theories.

Yet another step increased her fame and that is the fact that she made money out
of her discoveries. So much that she became the third richest person in the
solar system with her megacorp Zodiac.

At that time there were already four other global players, who were not so
global anymore. They made their money by mining asteroids, running space station
chains and interplanetary transport. All of them were eager to use the new tech.
But Marla and Zodiac owned many of the patents and had the talent and skills.

Even the name was wisely chosen as two of the other corporations were called
Sagittarius and Scorpio. Zodiac for them might have sounded like a declaration
of war, but at the same time, they needed access to that groundbreaking
technology.
