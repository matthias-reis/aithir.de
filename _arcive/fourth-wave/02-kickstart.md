In the 23rd century, humanity conquered the solar system the classical way. A
handful of super-rich mining corporations owned rocks, asteroids, planetoids and
whole moons and exploited their resources. They grew richer and more influential
than any earthbound state and became the kings of their own colonies.

One of them - whether it's a good or a bad trait - strove for more and was
longing for the worlds outside our solar system. So he (you knew it was a he,
right?) established a foundation called "The Sagittarius" to build a generation
starship. Destination **Alpha Centauri**, travelling time **40 years** at least.
He also wanted the pioneers to continue their exploration until the whole galaxy
is conquered.

Myriads of people followed his ideas and the project to build that gigantic
starship grew and thrived even generations after his death.

Centuries later, the construction came to an end and the ship was ready to take
off from the solar system.
