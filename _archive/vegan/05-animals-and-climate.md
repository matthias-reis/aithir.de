People say that moving to a vegan diet would have one of the biggest positive
effects for a private person's footprint. But in public discussions, it is
almost never mentioned.

The reason is probably that the effect is coming from a complex set of factors
that touch all aspects of the climate crisis.

The most obvious part also plays a significant role. Cows are producing methane.
About 30% of the total emission. But this is only responsible for 2% of the
green house effect. The same amount goes to Nitrogen fertilizers for feed
production. But many other effects are also included:

- Production
- Transport
- Deforestation

The current estimation of the overall share of the meat and dairy industry is
**14%**. When we only fight with the sources of the emissions and don't change
our habits, the share will rise to **23%-27% in 2030** and up to **80% in the
year 2050**.

It's hard to change the behaviour of the people. But in this sector, we have
proof that it's inevitable.
