The scientists were more pragmatic than Juliette had thought. They had put her
on the lead of the org team. The Dubliners and the O'Clares planned an
expedition together. They had to do fieldwork. The first destination was
Hamburg, where the other crew with the connection to the satellites lived.

Juliette herself, pregnant, seventh month, could not go. But she put a
formidable crew together. The main reason why Ruth was not in the lead was that
she clearly had to be part of the crew. She was number one. Ruben and David
O'Clare were in there as well. Siobhan from the Comms and Hannah, an
experimental Physicist had also been chosen by Juliette.

And then there was the Theologist, Rory Spencer, who volunteered. At age 59 he
was the oldest. But strategically, his knowledge could be of use.

Juliette was satisfied with her arrangements. She ordered some days of
preparation and training and arranged her office next to the Comms at Trinity.
The party was ready to set out.
