#Mesh - Landscapes

The freshly created pristine Mesh contained virtual landscapes that resembled
different regions of the earth from Antarctica over deserts to rainforests.

There is one unifying element, a gigantic river called **Lethe** that spans the
whole outside equator of the Mesh donut. The river is in some areas as wide as
an ocean but in other areas as small as 10 Units.

Besides that, you can find wide land, hills and mountains, forests and other
rivers and lakes all of which in the end float into the Lethe.

In the first year, the Mesh was exclusively opened for designers, architects and
companies in a closed Beta. They started to terraform the surface. They created
cities, they designed geometric structures, organic streets, artificial
monuments and re-created some of the landscapes to make them even more
interesting.

And they owned the first areas. They defined the first look of a world that was
meant to be changing over and over.
