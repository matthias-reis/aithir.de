I've found out that I need more categories for single articles. So after the
first [experiment with anecdotes](/posts/mesh-tales/01-swoosh) last week, here's
another one.

I knew I'd need the category "Politics", because every now and then a topic
comes around that needs to be voiced. So in this category it's all about what
our politicians do, what the voters do and what the media makes out of it.

**So why do I start this today?**

I come from a little rurual region in Germany, called Rhön, a place in the
middle of nowhere between Bavaria (well, actually in Bavaria) and Hesse. And
yesterday, local elections took place in both States.

The results are pretty much alarming. The right wing party AfD (Alternative for
Germany) has gained a lot of votes in both states and has become the second
strongest force behind the already pretty populistic, conservative CDU/CSU
(Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, part of the European EPP
block).

**Now to the interpretations.**

The major topic in the election campaign was the refugee situation. It was not
the climate crisis. Actually nobody really talked about it. The main theme in
the election campaigns of CDU (mid-right), Freie Wähler (right) and AFD (too far
right) was to bash the Green Party for their politics.

**In the results, I see two trends, one encouraging and the other alarming.**

- **Number one: Pro Future.** Let's say what you would need to prevent the
  climate crisis to happen would be 100%. The Green Party did not really good in
  that regard in the last two years. I'd assume they reached 50%. There are many
  reasons. But it is what it is. The problem is that none of the other parties
  reach above 20%. We are far away from saving the planet. But at least we see a
  large stability in the Green Party's numbers despite the head wind they are
  getting. So there is hope, there's still people (among voters and politicians)
  who know what needs to be done.
- **Number two: Pro Populism.** The refugee problem will not go away. And sadly
  nobody sees that it is directly connected to the climate crisis. The Sahel
  will be more or less inhabitable within the next 15 years. So people will
  move. They move towards Europe. Millions of them. We are neither prepared nor
  do we have the mindset at the moment to deal with these large numbers. So the
  impact will be drastic. We will try to guard our borders and we will watch
  while millions of Africans will drown in the Medierranean Sea.\
  Populists want to disrupt. And they will get disruption. Lots of it. Looking at
  the next five or ten years, you can easily imagine the numbers of right wing parties
  rise and rise while the blocks inbetween (Social Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals)
  will be ground and crumbled by the topics they can't handle anymore. Disruption
  will reach us and France like it did in Italy, Britain, Hungary and Poland.

Much too long post already. So I stop for now. The topic however might be worth
another look or two.
