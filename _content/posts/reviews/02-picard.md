The third and last episode of Star Trek: Picard, the TV series on Prime, is
finished. After season one, I thought it was the best I've ever seen. Season two
then brought it back on earth, figuratively. So how was season three and the
whole series?

You have to know, "The Next Generation" was my thing when I was young. I've
watched all 180-something episodes at least five times. It's a show that
actually contained real, stunning SciFi instead of the typical Space Opera style
of others. And I discussed many aspects with fellow fans in a thing called
usenet.

Why do I tell you all this? Well, I think Picard - looking at it from a neutral
point - is pure nostalgia. It allowed me to see all the favourite characters of
my youth again and formally say goodbye - Data, Geordi, Q, Guinan, of course
Picard. And it's great at celebrating these characters one last time.

But it was also not Science Fiction anymore. I loved it anyway.
