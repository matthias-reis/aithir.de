Mr Hanako had all the attention as he started.

"I've been going to the sea for over thirty years", he started. "Mostly on
smaller commercial merchant vessels. I've seen all the oceans and harbors in
over a hundred countries.

There was one day at sea that changed me. Cranes, we call them Tsuru, are
usually a symbol of luck, they say. No seaman I know has ever seen one on a
ship. They typically are avoiding to cross oceans.

But one day, I saw one. We were on the way to Hong Kong and approached the South
Chinese Sea from the south. The sea was as flat as a mirror and I was about to
clean the middle deck. I looked up and saw that beautiful guy landing on the
roof of the bridge. It was a perfect animal as it spread its wings. I saw the
large red dot on its head.

Must have been my lucky day, I thought. But while turning around to go back to
work, I saw a big dark cloud on the eastern horizon. 'Not so lucky after all', I
thought.
