It's done. I have finished my series of posts about climate change. I spawned
three Storylines. This one about [Energy as a whole](/storylines/world-2), one
about [traffic](/storylines/traffic) and a [vegan series](/storylines/vegan).
I've found out a lot along the way. But it's not enough.

This "not enough" has two sides. What we're doing right now is by far **not
enough**. Humans are short-sighted. The profit now is still more important than
the loss in ten years. We are so far behind that we can only hope to end with 2
degrees more temperature.

The second side is knowledge. The problem is utterly complex. Tipping points
here, synergies there. So a bunch of small posts are **not enough** to get a
grasp on the topic. Although everyone should know. Knowledge is the key to
solving the problem.

I'll try to continue to reduce it to small bits. This series is over, but I will
come up with new material.

Let's see if we continue to steer towards the end of the world or if we find a
proper navigation device to turn around.
