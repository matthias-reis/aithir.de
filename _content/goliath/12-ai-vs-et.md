After the first day, Goliath's training crew was disappointed. Nothing happened.
The aliens were still killing. From the continued interviews with the AI, the
crew also didn't get any insights.

It was day two when that perspective changed. Goliath reported contact in the
morning. And in the afternoon, it announced that it could gain access to the
aliens' comm systems. Another 24 hours later, it had learned their language.

Immediately after that, Goliath started gaining control over a bunch of military
micro-drones and started to experiment with one of the alien ships. For reasons,
the operators couldn't find out, the AI could pass the alien shields and break
through the hull of their spherical ships.

Six hours later, that ship lost contact with the others and the AI deactivated
it. Two more hours later, the ship exploded.

Goliath could move on now. It used the same strategy on half of the other ships
simultaneously. All of them blew up within minutes.

The rest fled into space.
