          Some weeks ago, my journey to cover both of my arms with tattoos has
          reached its end. Both of my arms are covered in ink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like almost every other tattooed person, I often get asked what
          the meaning of the motives is - or what they symbolize in my life. As
          if something that permanent would need to have a deeper cause ðŸ˜ƒ.
          Nope. They don't mean anything, they're "just" art.{' '}
          <strong>They acquire meaning by being on my skin.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          But as I'm into making up stories, I've also tried to find
          commonalities and a meaning or a small world that opens up when you
          look behind the already existing general themes and concepts. It's
          inspired by Ray Bradbury's "The Illustrated Man".
        </p>
        <p>
          My right arm is the fantasy side. Its story plays on a far east ocean
          and involves Shinto spirits and Japanese demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The left side combines science fiction and nature with cyborg
          creatures that turn nature into tech or vice versa.

        <p>
          This has been the story of my right arm. The left one is still not
          finished. So that story will be told on another day.
        </p>

        <p>
          The beautiful Tyto owl was the very first motive. It's over ten years
          old in the meantime.But the rest of the arm got it's torture just
          recently the whole procedure took several sessions over the span of a
          whole year and in the story, you will recognise all of its
          protagonists.
        </p>

        <p>
          This story is also the first playing in my cyberpunk world called The
          Mesh.
          <Link href="/storylines/mesh">
            If you're interested in its worldbuilding, I have created a full
            storyline around that.

          Initially, this story was formed by two ideas: How would we approach
          the topic of creating an AGI, a generel artificial intelligence. And
          why don&apos;t we let it fight against some nasty aliens. The movie
          Cowboys vs. Aliens came to my mind and the story was born. Also the
          story arc of splitting into two different and presumably independent
          parts was clear to me from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ideation phase happened way before Chat GPT and Large Language
          Models took off. I had imagined the scenario 20 or 30 years in the
          future. So the reality was faster this time.
