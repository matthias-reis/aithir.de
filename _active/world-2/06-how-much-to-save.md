    title: Global Carbon Budget
---

We know now that we're overshooting more than five times. But also the budget is
gone by 2050. At that point, we are not supposed to emit anything anymore. What
is left is what the trees, moors and oceans absorb.

Numbers say that about 1,9 Gt go into vegetation and 2,9 Gt are absorbed by the
oceans. That's 4,8 Gt or 34% of our current budget. So we have to reduce our
emissions from 539% to 34%.

It all boils down to three steps:

- **Electrification**: The main energy comes from electricity (e.g. electric
  cars or heat pumps for heating your living room). Exception: the heavy
  industry will need green hydrogen for their high energy density demand.
- **Green Electricity**: When all power comes from electricity, this must of
  course turn carbon neutral. Coal and gas must be replaced by wind, solar,
  biomass and water.
- **Saving Energy**: Who would have guessed that infinite growth is not
  sustainable? But there's also good news. Electric cars for example are much
  more efficient than combustion engines.
