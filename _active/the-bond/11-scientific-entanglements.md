Martin and the other leads of the first contact crew regularly spent their
evenings together with dinner and discussions since the launch of the mission.
One day, about four months after the first contact, Amanda, the chief biologist,
came out of nowhere with a topic. "These are no aliens", she said and got the
attention of everyone in the room.

The Kret were so similar to us in their phsiology, that people speculated from
the beginning. But now, Amanda said, there was proof.

"We have the results now", she continued. "we are gentically related. We don't
know every detail yet, but we are pretty sure that the split could have happened
about 100 to 200 thousand years ago."

The others had stopped eating and stared at her in a jaw-dropping way. It took
Martin a full minute to recover and ask his first question.

"What do you think happened one hundred thousand years ago?", he asked and the
speculations began.
