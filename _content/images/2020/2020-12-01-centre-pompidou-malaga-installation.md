title: Juan Mu침oz - Centre Pompidou M치laga
category: Art
description:
  These puppet-like sculptures by Spanish artist Juan Mu침oz create a haunting,
  theatrical atmosphere in the gallery space. The uniform chairs and the
  elongated faces add an air of eerie uniformity, inviting viewers to ponder
  themes of identity and collective experience.
