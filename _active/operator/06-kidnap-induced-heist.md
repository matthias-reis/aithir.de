"Glad you have found our message", a distorted voice said with a noticeable
ironic undertone. "We have your girlfriend. You know that. Hugo Niemann, you

"That is what they sent me", said `B055` to `R00t` in their virtual home base

the cops."

"We can't go to the cops. That would be the end of our work and my home in the
Pylons. We have to do it."

"You're right. I'm frightened, but I'm also pissed. Hugo, we have to do
something. We're better than this."

"What do you have in mind?" asked `B055` finally.
