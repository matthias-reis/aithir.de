The auditorium had already been crowded before. Almost all residents of trinity
college were there. But now, after Juliette had entered the spacious stage area,
the other four dozen clan members streamed in and caused a noise and confusion
level the halls had not seen for 25 years.

Two of them pulled a small wagon with the box on it and drove it to the podium
area that was lit by a suitable dimmed but still bright enough spotlight.

The O'Clares slowly calmed down. They formed a semi-circle around the box. Only
Juliette, Ruth and Paul stood directly next to the dirty, wooden cube. Paul
opened some locks and fiddled with the fixing mechanism for a while like a
magician preparing his trick. The audience reacted with tensioning silence. The
scholars on one side and the wild bunch on the other.

Then the wooden walls folded down and cleared the view for a steel cage with a
small horned creature inside.

"We call him Scrooge", shouted Ruth into the round.
