I stood up and entered the courtroom. The strict and conservative Judge Farcas
had the chair. But there were also others in the room. Bram Stoker was not there
yet. Jonathan Harker represented him and said that the writer would arrive later
when I was supposed to give my statement.

There were also four representatives of the registry, I assume lawyers and two
further judges that observed the procedure. A hermetic trial differs a bit from
a civil one. Farcas, the judge owns the procedure. He is asking questions and he
manages the timing and the heard witnesses. The backup judges can only veto if
something unjust is happening.

So Farcas was swearing me in and explained the circumstances and the charge to
me. After about half an hour of bootstrapping procedure, he called for a lunch
break.

Now, two hours later, I am standing here in front of him to give my
interpretation of the proceedings around Vlad Tepes and Stoker and fill them
with so much proof that the case should be clear.
