I've promised some backstory to my tattoos and I want to start with my **right
arm**. But it needs a bit of prologue:

Mr. Hanako was a silent man. Three days a week, he went into the pub in
Immingham, Middle England. As he didn't talk much, no one of the regulars in the
pub knew his story. He was a Japanese seaman and somehow, probably because of a
woman, landed in the biggest port of England.

When the talks on the main table, where the regulars were sitting day-in and
day-out, circled around seaside tales, he sometimes contributed a sentence or
two. But never much.

One day, someone on the table again started a topic about the seaside. He began
a wild story about some hearsay monsters that appeared to medieval seafarers.

Suddenly, Mr. Hanako stood up and said "Do you want to hear a real story? I'm
ready to tell you mine ...".

The whole pub fell silent. Tension was rising and Mr. Hanako started speaking.

To be continued ...
