Six years into the project, Goliath's supervising team declared the
**Singularity**. The psychologists and other scientists created an extensive
test suite that represented human-level capability in all fields of proficiency.
Goliath passed all of them.

The technological singularity is the point in time, where the first AI becomes
better than any human and marks a point of no return through its exponential
growth of knowledge.

Although this was predicted as a tipping point not only for the machine but for
humanity as a whole, the team assured that the system is fully under control
through its containment and fixed computing capacities.

Also, the philosophical discourse around the conscience of machines was ongoing.
Although this was not part of the singularity experiments, the philosophers and
neuroscientists conducted a set of interviews around self-awareness which didn't
end in proof but also not in disproof of conscience.
