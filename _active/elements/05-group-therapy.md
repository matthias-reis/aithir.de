Juliette always refers to them as the elder, but Ruth and Paul, the clan's
official leaders are not actually wise. They have a lot of street knowledge
though. And they brought the O'Clares through hard times and made everyone keep
their faith.

Now the clans thought leaders were sitting in a circle around that box that was
shaking from time to time with the movement of the demon inside. There was
Juliette of course, the two elders, Ruben and his friend Thom, who caught the
thing, and others. Overall eight people discussed for a whole hour what to do
now.

"We have to bring him to the scholars", Ruben said finally. And he was right as
always in such moments when decisions were needed.

The group, however, discussed five more minutes around the obvious until Ruth
stood up and said. "Aye then, let's finally meet those dusty bastards again."

Next stop: Dublin, Juliette thought. And she somehow liked that thought.
