The third and last council of the Hermetic Society call themselves The
Observers. The official name is "Council of Observation and Justice". Just like
the other three, this organisation is centrally organised as well and spawns
countless subsidiaries around the world.

It is also the oldest of the three councils. Its foundation dates back to 7.500
BC proven by a piece of slate called the Stone Charter of Horon. It contains the
constitution for all Hermetics and the fundamental laws they must adhere to.

The Observers have two tasks, which you would nowadays call executive and
judicial power. They are the Court and the Secret Service of the Society
combined in one organisation, which forms the most powerful independent
organisation you never heard of.

Some of their duties are:

- investigation, enforcement and jurisdiction in acts of mind terror
- unallowed hermetic activities
- surveillance of factions that act outside the society
