I got started with the concept of the Mesh back in the late eighties when I had
read Neuromancer. So it was way before Zuckerberg's Metaverse and the modern
world that is on the brink of introducing Augmented Reality to our everyday
life. But one part is missing to becoming Cyberpunk: the real world.

Cyberpunk is a melange combining virtual worlds with a most often dystopian
future. But there is no way to include the real world in a world-building
concept. As an author and inventor of stories, you have to feel it. You have to
re-live future world scenes in your head. Everything must come to life.

You might have already read the first part of the first storyline playing with
the Mesh. I've also dedicated the story of my left arm's tattoo motives to this
universe. Expect much more where this comes from. I have so much fun writing
this.

World-building is not a necessary tool for consistency. It's a source of ideas.
I hope you'll enjoy it.
