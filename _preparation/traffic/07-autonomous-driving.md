The infrastructure around cars is massive. Besides gigantic investments in
public infrastructure (roads, traffic lights, etc.), there also is the personal
side. A car always has a parking space where it rests for 23 hours every day of
the year. In many cases, this space is a garage that takes away space to live.
However, the dominant resource is the driver.

But what if cars became drones, driving autonomously?

They could move 24/7. We could share them very efficiently, and wouldn't even
need a parking spot for them. People would get off the car could go to its next
assignment.

Autonomous driving combined with intelligent services could become the future
way of transport-with similar flexibility like todaz but without the immense
resource abuse.

Drawbacks: People need to give up their need to own their car-to possess. Day in
day out, people often have the same routes. Public transport covers this more
efficiently than autonomous car drones. So the system must be combined.
