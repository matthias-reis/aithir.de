They had chosen a small, well-maintained and quite comfortable passagemaker
yacht from the harbour in Dublin. Two of the scientists had been nautic
hobbyists and valid captains and joined them on their trip to Hamburg. It took
them three days. During that time they had permanent radio contact with the
Dublin HQ, Juliette and with Hamburg.

After the arrival, they could spend a nice evening with some new faces after all
these years and went to work on the next day. Ruth obviiously took over. It
turned out that she was a software engineer before the incident. She knew
everything about computers and the system they had in Hamburg was a bliss as
soon as she sat in front of it rather than triggering some remote commands.

After some minutes, they had proper footage from a set of weather satellites.
The reslolution was amazing. They could zoom down and even see trees. After half
an hour, Ruth found out how to move the satellites into new positions. She sent
the commands. Now they had to wait.
