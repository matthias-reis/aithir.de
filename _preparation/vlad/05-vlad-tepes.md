It took us five full days to sift and catalogue the material. Nine out of ten
resources came from Sir Egmont. So we focused mainly on the other ten per cent
and the material I brought from outside. That gave us a somehow reliable picture
of Vlad Tepes.

For all we know, he was a charismatic man, not at all like his crude father, the
one they called Draculea first. Vlad didn't slaughter men and ate them for
breakfast. Instead, he gathered groups of Hermetics around himself, held parties
and also orgies. He had a big entourage and surely some of them were shadier
than the average Transylvanian.

The core of the scandal around Vlad, however, was something different. He wanted
to go public. He wanted to break law number one of the Hermetic Society and tell
the world who we are. That was why Egmond the Chronist tried to stop Vlad.

Thankfully, after this week of dusty research, we had some leads to follow. I
took Maxim with me, this time on a much longer journey to the archives in
Vienna.
