The human expedition was planned for a lifetime commitment. Observing and
studying a new species was the ultimate adventure that you could embark on in
Earth's 23rd century.

But it would not be a job in isolation and deprivations like many other
scientific expeditions. The team was huge. About 200 people were on the space
station that circled planet Kret.

There were all kinds of disciplines involved. From microbiologists to
theologists.

Besides the station in Kret's orbit, there also was a cloaked outpost on the
planet that mainly hosted relay technology for small robots. They called them
"The Bugs". They were only around 1 cm large but equipped with cameras,
microphones, other sensors and mainly an intelligence that could take autonomous
decisions.

First goal: Don't get caught! Second goal: Record and filter as much relevant
information as possible.

The team on the space station had a lot of material to explore.
