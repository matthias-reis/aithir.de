Veganism is no religion, as many claim. I think it's two things: a set of rules
that help you easily navigate through the giant stream of consumption. When you
follow them, you most likely do the right thing for your body, the environment
and in any case for the animals. And it's a mindset. It's the thought that we
evolved from other animals and therefore we can't draw a line.

In this series, we've seen what effects dairy and meat have on us and our
environment. it is inevitable that the whole human race is more and more
acquiring the vegan mindset.

This is not a "we should one day" or an "if we did that, the world would be
better". No. It is an existing process. This transformation is already
happening. If you take a closer look, you will see that this great opposition is
only the last childish rebellion against common sense.

I hope you enjoyed this storyline and
[read it again as a whole](/storylines/vegan). Thank you for listening.
