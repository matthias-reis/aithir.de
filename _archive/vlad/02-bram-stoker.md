Why I have to deal with such an old case now, you might ask? Well, the reason is
a much more recent incident of type B, filed under the name "Stoker". It is
about the publication of a book by the honourable member of the Hermetic Society
Bram Stoker.

This man is currently listed in the Registry of Dublin as a level 7 Hermetic,
but he is better known for his athletic abilities, his experiments with electro
shocks and his writings. The reason for this investigation is his novel
"Dracula", published seven years ago, which is based on the old Drac Incident,
but consciously gave a wrong interpretation of the events.

It is now on me to find out what in the book is historically correct, what is
poetic imagination and what could be dangerous for the Society. I am absolutely
sure that Stoker will land in front of a Hermetic court and that these
investigations will bear all evidence for the case. Time will tell if he will be
convicted or not. I for one will be as impartial as possible.
