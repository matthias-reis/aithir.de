The train is the iconic attraction on the Mesh. Technically, nobody needs a
transportation facility in the virtual world. Just go to the next teleporter and
pick your target area and there you are. The train has a different purpose.

Its monorail is precisely spanning the outer equator. It is built at a height of
500 u, way above the height of buildings. The rail is constructed as a
transparent tube and the trains wagons are also equipped with generous windows.
The sight if you sit in there takes your breath away. This is a trip everyone
should do from time to time.

Every 16 sectors, there is a stop. The 256 iconic trainstations are designed by
the best architects. Toe northern, eastern, southern and western stations are
the most well known buildings in the virtual world. The `@root` travelling hub
on the south pole, where the majestic train station and the main entry into the
VR fall together, is the epicenter of the whole Mesh.
