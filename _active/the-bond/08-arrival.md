Arriving in the Rana system was less spectacular than Martin thought. The
blackness of the space there followed the blackness between the systems. The
only difference was a star that shone a bit brighter than usual. They still had
two days until they were supposed to reach the orbit.

Martin also knew that it was not planned to meet the aliens directly after their
arrival. The plan was a detailed half-year observation mission before first
contact. But it was a change for good for the surprisingly impatient diplomat.

He was not the mission lead, but in the council and so he had enough to do,
enough to think. They reached the orbit of Rana 3 and Martin's mood immediately
changed. Actually, everyone on the ship turned from impatient waiting mode to
planned activity. Probes were prepared. Camouflage surveillance drones were sent
to the ground. Translator systems were set up. Teams started to make theories.
And Martin absorbed the information for his first contact strategy.
