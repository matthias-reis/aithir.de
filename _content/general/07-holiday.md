Hej people, last day before my holidays. I'd like to use the opportunity to
showcase some of the posting series that I started in the last months:

["Transspace"](/storylines/transspace), a series about a new space-time theory
of everything.

["Kret"](/storylines/kret), more world-building scifi posts, this time it's
about another alien race.

["The Fourth Wave"](/storylines/fourth-wave), conquering the galaxy the hard
scifi way.

["Hermetics"](/storylines/hermetics), the backstory of our fantasy novel about
magicians.

["The Mesh"](/storylines/mesh), how could/should a 3d internet look like?

["AI Jobs"](/storylines/ai-jobs) on how professions could be optimized away and
replaced by AI.

["Tattoos"](/storylines/tattoos), the invented backstory of the motives on my
arms.

["Goliath"](/storylines/goliath), a multipart short story about an AI for now -
could go somewhere else, too.

["World 2"](/storylines/world-2), some real-world thoughts about the causes of
the climate crisis.
