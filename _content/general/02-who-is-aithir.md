**Ether**, that is how they called the hypothetical medium in which light
travelled - until about 150 years ago. It was somehow magic because nobody had
proof that it existed. It just lived in some mind experiments. Latest in the
year 1887, this haunting came to an end with the famous Michelson-Morley
experiment that they still teach at school.

But the term, which could be traced back to the Greek God Aither or Aithir,
stayed alive. It became a synonym for TV transmissions and was used as the name
of one of our most important network specifications, the Ethernet.

So fifteen years ago, when I searched for a suitable alias for all these
accounts in the social networks, Aithir popped up at that time. This name seemed
perfect for me. Many interpretations and connotations, so cool. One year later,
it wore down already and that user name felt as nerdy as collecting D20 dices
(ðŸ‘€).

But my alias was there to stay.
