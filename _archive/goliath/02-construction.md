Around six months into the project, the first iteration of the machine core was
finished and the software was ready to receive data. The creator engineers had
chosen an architecture that had similarities with the human brain.

Some parts of the machine were autonomous neural networks and could directly
backfire results. The majority of requests were handled by the parts that the
engineers actually called the Neocortex. This consisted of a neural network
whose purpose was to engineer and train other neural networks based on the
incoming use case. An AI that could create other AI to fulfill jobs.

Other parts had dedicated duties like processing or generating natural language
or indexing, filtering and pre-structuring incoming data.

Now the hardware guys only needed to provide extensible storage and processing
power.

In the beginning, the racks did not even fill a tenth of the data center. But
that was supposed to change over time.
