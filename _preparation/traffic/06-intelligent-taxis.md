Yesterday, we had to use a bus from the public transport system as well as a
taxi. The bus was almost empty - four passengers only, so both rides were not
very sustainable and also not cheap. In Hamburg and some other cities in
Germany, there are more intelligent systems now - intelligent hybrids between
those two.

They are small EV buses, suitable for eight passengers and they come with an
algorithm powered centrally managed pickup system. As a passenger, you request a
ride with a smartphone app. Then the system chooses the best drivers and alters
their tour a little bit. You are not driving alone. Along the way, other
passengers might be picked up as well.

This is quite an efficient way in the city. But as a centralized system, it's
hard to scale. Especially as it's also commercial. It has to make money. Systems
like that usually don't work in the country side. But they can give a hint which
systems might be a future-proof approach.
