The mesh is a dynamic model. A renderer only loads what it currently needs. On
the outside, this divides the world into areas. But the inside of buildings is
only loaded when your avatar enters them.

There are no physical rules for the geometry of building interior. The geometry
doesn't even have to fit. As a designer, you could build a small Swedish cabin
by a lake and make the inside a huge warehouse for space rockets.

On the other hand, some views on the torus are so spectacular, that you want to
provide windows to look outside. The best example is one of the high towers next
to one of the giant spokes of the torus construct. At 1.000 u height, you can
oversee the whole curving with the city structures and the far-out landscapes
below.

The architectural design - interior like exterior - is therefore an art form in
itself. Just like in the real world it spans from profane and off-the-shelf to
masterfully crafted and genius. And it changes its form every day.
