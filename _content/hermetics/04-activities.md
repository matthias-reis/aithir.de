We all know magic at least from fairy tales and movies. All of the stories have
a true core, but most of them have added some exaggerations along the lines of
history.

Magic is the interaction with the Mana of other persons or items. It is not
capable of physical effects like teleportation or telekinesis or force fields
coming out of nowhere.

What actually works is the connection between the different astral bodies. A
stage five hermetic can feel another hermetic when entering a building. On stage
8, you can even sense the other one's strength.

When a hermetic is strong enough, they can intrude into the other's astral field
and influence them.

While the own capabilities can't decline, the body itself can get exhausted
while using mana.

With so much impact on the privacy of other beings, it is clear that the grand
Hermetic Society has postulated a set of ethical guidelines. More on that in the
next post.
