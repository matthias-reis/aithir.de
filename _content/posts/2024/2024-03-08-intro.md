A good possibility to explore our own human evolution is to look at fictional
aliens that made other choices throughout their history. Many "what if" moments
will apperar when you do so and all of that lets you connect the dots of our own
history.

THe Kret, an alien species, is my approach to that topic.

If you want deeper insights first, I recommend you to read the
[World Building article about the Kret](/storylines/kret) first.
