I think a lot of people who start to eat healthier come to a point where they
have to explain their eating habits to others. Why can't you come with us to
this restaurant? Can't we just go to Burger King? What's wrong with this salad?
This is especially true for vegans, at least in my personal experience. So what
is the vegan diet?

Vegans simply don't eat anything that comes directly or indirectly from animals
(except natural the act of dusting a blossom). For an easy start, you may have
this list in mind

- no meat (neither pork, beef, chicken, lamb or cangaroo)
- no fish and no sea food
- no milk and other dairy products
- no cheese (especially)
- no eggs
- no honey

But beware of some pitfalls. If you want to live strictly vegan, there are some
nasty ingredients, you also have to avoid.

- Gelatin is made out of the bone marrow of a pig or a pork and is used in gummy
  bear sweets, jello, mousses and a lot of other stuff
- Many wines and vinegars, especially red wines are also cleared with gelatin.
  This goes also for a lot of soft drinks from apple juice to lemonades
  depending on the brand
- A lot of non german beer brands (including e.g. Guinness) clear their products
  with isinglass, which is a substance from a fish's swim bladder
- Some of the famous E food additives are not vegan like E 120 carmine (red
  colour coming from a coccid insect), E 322 lecithine (could come from egg
  protein), E 901 bee wax, E 904 shellac (also from a coccid) and several others
  with potential animal origin

## Why should you turn to a vegan diet?

Actually there are 3 major reasons for becoming a vegan and personal taste is
actually not even one of them. Believe me no one wants to look on every package
to see which E additives are used. So we directly go to the important stuff.

### Reason 1: The Animals

Most vegans are animal friends or even animal activists. The life of an animal
is not worth less than the life of a human. But even if you are not such a
radical mind with genes to actively fight against animal inequality, you will
definitely sooner or later see, that things go very wrong in the meat industry.

There are too many of us and therefore the demand for meat and animal products
is much too high to be able to produce this in a human and non-painful way for
the animals.

It starts with the obvious. Just go for some real world documentaries on chicken
farming, cow slaughter processes and pig stables.

But even processes that are established for centuries are crude. A cow, that
should give milk for example, needs one pregnancy and one calf per year. The
calf is then separated from its mother directly after birth and kept within
listening distance, which is a torture for the cow and the calf. And that's just
for having a product, that is specially designed by nature as a nutrition for a
calf. Humans in their firs months have to get accustomed to this product and
some of them have an intolerance against it for their lifetime.

### Reason 2: Health

There are several aspects in the health area. The most important ones are the
lack of cholesterol in almost every meal, which is especially good for a bureau
worker with genetical predisposition for heart disease reaching back several
generations like me.

Secondly you automatically eat fresher and more conscious, buy more organic
products, giving me vitamins en masse without taking any pill. And adding to
that, things like antibiotics in cheap meat, moldy and rotten products and
rainbow colored slices of sausage are a thing from the past.

And thirdly for me most importantly, by restricting to only vegan products the
temptation is gone to go for a snack, a donut, a piece of cake or chocolate
while working. You will quit convenience food, microwave stuff and deep frozen
pizza automatically because any of these products surely contain ingredients you
don't eat as a vegan.

### Reason 3: The Environment

To me the most important aspect overall was to reduce my personal ecologic
footprint. I try to find a low energy flat, quit my car some years ago and drink
water directly from the tap.

But did you know that CO<sub>2</sub> coming from industry, cars and heating is
actually not the main reason for the greenhouse effect? No, it's **stock
farming**, giant cattle herds in South America and the US.

A cow produces methane which has a 28 times higher greenhouse potential than the
same amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and remains much longer in the atmosphere because
the resorbation rate is lower.

For an equivalent to a delicious well hung rib eye steak from good Argentinian
beef in a restaurant in my neighborhood, I could easily get into a Porsche
Cayenne, drive from Hamburg to the Côte d'Azur and back and have an even more
delicious vegan meal there  -  both have the same impact on the greenhouse
effect.

## Final Words

Three important reasons as I think. And as I said, personal taste is
