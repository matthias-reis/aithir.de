Ten thousand teenagers went on a journey from the Procyon system into their new
life in the system of Luyten's Star.

As the journey was supposed to take 12 years, the ship actually was their home.
It contained everything you need to live but also to prepare for the important
task to build a fresh civilisation on another planet. There were bars and
restaurants, entertainment stations as well as science and educational
facilities.

The journey was split into three phases. A six months acceleration phase at 1g
where they profited from their light sails and laser pulses, a long drifting
phase in which gravity was generated by rotating habitats and an about 1 year
long decelerating phase toward the end of the journey.

Many families had already been founded onboard the ship. This was explicitly
encouraged. While the journey started with 12.880 passengers, there were 15.791
who arrived in Luyten's system.

Now it was time to find their new home.
