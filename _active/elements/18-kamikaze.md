As the plane came nearer to the Purgatory Islands, they got a clearer view. The
islands were not at all contaminated with demons as the crew had expected. They
looked peaceful. There were dwellings on the eastern coast, beautifully
architectured houses arranged around terraces and squares.

Some kilometers later, Ruth saw the vortex in detail, the demons that fought to
get out and the blackness below.

Back in France, they took the whole evening to find out what to do next. Could
this invasion be stopped? Were they doomed? They, humanity? The group had to do
something against it. The Theologist and Ruben came out with it almost at the
same time.

"We should take the boat", they said. The coincidence of saying it together made
it a bit less awkward. What they suggested was a Kamikaze journey, an Orphean
trip right into the mouth of hell.

On that day, they didn't dare to talk to the Dublin headquarters. That could
wait until the next morning.
