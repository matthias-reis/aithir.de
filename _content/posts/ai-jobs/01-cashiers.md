  The checkout in a supermarket is a highly repetitive, tedious and error prone
  task, already optimized for the cashier. Will the human faactor be removed one
  day?

A study in the US calculated the probability that a job will be taken over by AI
or computers in general in the future. I've been thinking about this for quite
some time and would like to create another series of posts from it.

I'm starting with cashiers in supermarkets and other retail stores. There are
3.1 million employees in this area in Germany today - about a third in full
time. And as of now with some base investment Thais could be done with more
precision and more convenience for the customer by computers. AI is not even
needed.

Demo stores have been developed by Amazon and others already a decade or more
ago. Several supermarkets have already added self-checkouts.

So I assume that some of the cashiers will shift into a service role but many
jobs will not be needed anymore. My estimation: a decline of 50% within the next
10 years.
