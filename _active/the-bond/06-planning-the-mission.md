During the 22 missions before one of the probes targeted the Rana Starsystem,
the Gemini project already had found two planets with lifeforms. One infected
with funghi and another one with an almost breathable atmosphere and grass-like
plants.

But Rana was different. The Star system is about 30 Lightyears away and already
the first spectroscopic studies showed life signs and activity. The Gemini
headquarters immediately sent orders for visual observation, so the probe sent
out a bunch of drones with hi-res optics. There were settlements and humanoid
lifeforms dwelling on that planet.

So the next step was clear. A mission was planned. The wharves around titan and
in the Jupiter orbit were routined. Within one year they conceived and built a
ship for a 100 people crew. Staff selection and training started and strategies
were formed by the brightest minds that could be found on earth.

The crew consisted of sociologists, linguists, biologists, engineers and a
handful of reporters.
