"I have always been more of a scientist than a man of god. But sometimes these
topics fall together. This is the time we live in." The Theologist lectured in
front of his audience of about 40 people. It was memorial day ceremony, 25 years
after the outbreak. All lectures in Trinity College were history lessons of what
happened before and after the events.

But the Theologist gave it a twist. "We have seen demons", he said. "Yes, I know
what you will say. There's no proof. But we all have seen the footage and heard
the sounds over the wire, haven't we?"

At that moment, the door opened and a dramatic, divine ray of light fell into
the dimmed auditorium. Shadowy creatures entered carrying a large shrine. At
least that is what the Theologist thought at that moment.

Then someone, a woman, a pregnant woman stepped out of her silhouette and
approached the lectern, pushed the Theologist slightly but determinedly away and
proclaimed "We have proof!".
