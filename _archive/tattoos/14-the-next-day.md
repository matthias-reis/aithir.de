For the work on her virtual travel blog, Lucy was well-equipped for excursions
like that. She had two cameras constantly taking video of her and the scene.
Also, she took additional hand shots and hi-res stills to be able to go into
details. But as she looked at her media library the next day, nothing was in
there.

There was no proof that she even was at that magic place. Nothing she could use,
except her memories. Even the coordinates were wiped out of the system's
history.

But wait. She found one file from the previous day. Its name:
prunus-digitalis.tgz. She unpacked it and found one text document and an
executable. She opened the file. There was only one sentence: "For your eyes
only".

Then she dared to activate the executable. She found herself back in the tree.
She could go forward and backwards in time and watch herself explore the digital
wonder from every angle. But she never managed to copy any content out of it.
