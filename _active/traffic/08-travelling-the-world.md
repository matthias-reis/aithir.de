Cars are everywhere. I guess they are by far the most visible means of
transport. But they cover only parts of the emission. Public transport and
trains form another sector. But we have that under control. The one that is left
is flying.

People love going on holidays. Twice a year they use planes to get into warmer
areas. Sometimes travelling 10.000 km or more spending 10 times the annual
budget just for one trip. Even more problematic are the often shorter business
trips, because they are more frequent and even less necessary in WFH and video
conferencing times.

The problem is that there is no green replacement for jet engines yet. One day
planes might be propelled with Hydrogen or E-Kerosine, but that technology takes
another 10 or 15 years to produce the needed amounts.

Until then, the only solution might be to slow down in your holidays and get on
a train to visit your favourite Italian city or Spanish beach.
