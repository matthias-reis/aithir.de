Today, we have made history. We have arrived in the Rahl star system. Our
teachers said that this would complete the 5000th wave.

We have incoming transmissions from countless star systems - all of them from
different points in time. Some of the streams are 10.000 years old. Good that
our machines can filter the most important information. They permanently update
the story of the established planets. I believe some of the other colonies might
even be controlled by machines in the meantime.

The streams still contain rumours about our origin, the old Earth. But all these
tales sound like myths. If you follow the data back for a million years, you
might find some traces in the big Luytena Empire.

There are also other rumours. Those about aliens - as if humanity wasn't alien
enough here on these outpost planets. But these seem to contain more truth than
myth. I even saw video footage of huge abandoned artificial artefacts.

Well, nothing seems to exist forever.
