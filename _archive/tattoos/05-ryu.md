I remember things. Visions from when I was underwater. After I fainted, I must
have been drifting around. And I saw things. well, I believe I dreamt of them.

First, there was Koromodako. You may know him from his other name, Ctulhu. A
giant squid, several meters large. I really believe he held me above the water
with one of his tentacles. We Japanese believe in Yokai, natural spirits, just
like you believe in Saints. Koromodako didn't speak but I believe he
communicated with me through his mind.

After that, I saw other sea creatures, Heikegani, a giant crab and others. I
also have memories of skulls drifting on the still stormy seaâ€”presumably my dead
colleagues.

At last, the Ryu came. The giant sea dragon. The lord of all the other creatures
that now retreated and stepped back into the shadows where they came from.

"Hello Mr. Hanako", said Watatsumi, the Dragon, in a terrifying voice. "You have
a powerful guardian."

Then I fainted again.
