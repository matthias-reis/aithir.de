Time for a small recap session regarding the vegan lifestyle. In the last post,
we found out that meat and dairy have a 14% share in climate change. That brings
the average German down from 539% of the available budget to 464%. Solid but
apparently only a part of the equation.

But this part is available right now for everyone. It just has to make click in
your head.

Mass meat and dairy production on the other hand comes with a much bigger
footprint in another crisis: Biodiversity. I know. Yet another crisis doesn't
even fit in our heads anymore. But fighting the climate crisis the right way
might come with many synergies with stopping the extinction of species, when you
do it the right way. It will be worth it, because in a climate catastrophe, many
of us will suffer, but after a biodiversity ELE all humans will be wiped out.

So take this post as an advertisement for going vegan. In the next posts, there
are even some more benefits to discover.
