As mentioned in a posting before, the Kret, my imagined aliens, are
astonishingly (or let's say suspiciously) similar to us humans. They could even
walk through Stockholm or Hamburg without being noticed.

However, they are slightly larger - about 1.89 m on average. This could be
related to the lower gravity of planet Kret. Men often don't have any top hair
and no beards. Women have dark and short hair.

After the first contact, scientists could dive deeper into that phenomenon and
found similar DNA, but encountered a deviation in the genetic lines that date
back to about 100,000 years. So all differences can be explained by the
different environments and a small original genetic pool.

On the planet, they found terrestrial genetic profiles based on DNA in plants
and animals, but they also came across a second line of plants with very unique
biology.
