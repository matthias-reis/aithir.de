I need to tell you more about the Secret Society that stands behind everything.
In fact, it's the biggest organization of mankind that you've never heard of. It
was founded **10.000 years ago**. At that time, only 2 million human beings
existed in the world. And so only a handful was strong in Mana.

Still, some of them met in the thriving Middle East and founded the society that
grew ever since. They had been influencing life and politics long before the
term politics was invented. But they have managed to stay hidden since the
beginning. They are the puppet masters of the world.

The Society splits up into decentralized and rather independent cells or lodges
that spread worldwide. The hierarchical structure is not necessarily tied to
magical strength. As usual, it's a composition of the will to organize and lead,
the strive for power and the actual hermetic capabilities. So it's not always
the most capable who leads the pack.
