I'm starting with one of the most obvious tropes of all: Aliens. Other
intelligent species are at the heart of at least half of all sci-fi and a good
bunch of mystery stories. Aliens are fascinating for us because they represent
both, a threat and great opportunities.

The aliens in the stories almost never represent both. They are either enemies
wanting to kill humanity - most of the time for the resources on our planet. Or
they are friendly allies.

Aliens are fascinating because their existence would give us the opportunity to
extend our knowledge quickly at a speed where classic science would take
centuries. This is the perfect vessel for another sci-fi trope: dealing with new
knowledge.

But the main trope aliens are used for is the mirror. Aliens mirror human
stereotypes to the extreme, so a story can focus on them through a sociological
microscope.

From pure rational Vulcans to the Overlords in Arthur C. Clarke's "Childhood's
End", all of them tell us something about ourselves.
