Power is something very abstract. Its distribution has a long history, many
dependencies and some unexplainable effects. Among the humans on Earth,
individuals and organizations have power that does not necessarily exert
physical dominance. Furthermore, power can have a far-reaching impact and
restrict billions of people.

In contrast, the established social structures of Kret work completely
differently. Power and dominance exist there as well, but they are usually
limited to a few hundred to a thousand individuals. They are more transient and
volatile.

However, the caste of judges is interesting, a group of people who live
completely outside the rest of society. They exercise legal authority and thus
wield absolute power by dispensing justice and justice only, no wealth, no other
influence, no executive power outside their own bubble.

But even they are installed with balance and mutual control to prevent things
from getting out of hand. Additionally, by definition, the caste has no worldly
claims.

The result was to be expected: more individuality, more justice, infinitely more
peace, but less reality-altering progress. But what is better?
