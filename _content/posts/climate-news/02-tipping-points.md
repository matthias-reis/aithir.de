Yesterday, I saw a disturbing video clip listing three of the next tipping
points. Especially the third one almost made me sick.

- **Coral bleaching**. I don't see this as that much of a tipping point. It's
  rather as an indicator. However, it is happening right now. So, we have
  already reached one of the points. Corals are bleaching in large quantities,
  currently about 35-40% in Australia. It is the fifth wave since 2016.

- **Forest dieback**. Anyone driving through the German Harz region can already
  see this effect. Drought is causing monoculture forest areas to become
  vulnerable. The bark beetle also has an easy time. But the tropical rainforest
  will be affected, too. And this is one of the largest CO₂ sinks we have. So,
  this is a real tipping point. The more forest is lost, the less CO₂ can be
  removed from the atmosphere.
- **Greenland ice**. There is land under the ice sheet there. We all know that.
  But land is dark, and lighter snow reflects more sunlight back into space than
  dark land. Here, too, a spiral sets in. The more ice melts, the more heat the
  land absorbs, the more ice melts. This will happen in the coming decades. The
  ice present there can cause the oceans to rise by a staggering 7 meters. This
  threatens all coastal cities and the existence of one billion people.
