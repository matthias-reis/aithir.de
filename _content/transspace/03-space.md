The space dimensions are well known. They already existed in some form even in
earlier theories. Einstein gave them the twist that these dimensions are curved
and that mass affects the amount of bending.

The (imaginary) Transspace has given them another angle that changed or extended
some of our imagination of the three space dimensions.

The theory itself is computer-assisted. An AI and a Quantum Computer have
calculated most of the equations' solutions.

One of them predicts that all dimensions fold into themselves. So very
simplified, you could say if you travel some billion years in the same
direction, you might be able to reach your starting point again.

Some distant galaxy we observe with our telescope might even be our own milky
way in its early days.
