The crews of the two ships formed a committee to plan the settlements when they
approached their new star system. Some of the young people became experts in
fields they would need. The committee was dominated by them.

The first task was to send out fast probes and search for the perfect habitat
and the joy was huge when they actually found a suitable planet. The next
mission was to send neuros and modellers to build homes and terraforming
stations.

Also, they directly started developing plant types that could enrich the
atmosphere quickly with enough oxygen to breathe. With a bit of luck, already
the next generation, the children who had been born onboard the generation
ships, could breathe outside the sealed habitats.

When they arrived, only the committee and a small group of pioneers moved onto
the planet's surface. The rest stayed comfortably on board. Some of them waited
several years until they decided to move to their new home.
