I'd like to start my journey into veganism with a look into the future. We are
on a camping ground, mainly because I'm writing this from the side of a camper
van. 50 years fast forward.

The old couple next to us is classy. They drink their red wine from proper
glasses. And they sit in front of a miniature screen watching TV shows each
evening. I haven't seen such a thing for a long time. But they enjoy it. He, a
man with a white long beard and a lot of tattoos, is a smoker. But he's not into
cigarettes. I haven't seen such stupid things for decades either. No. He's
smoking his food.

For the whole day he's following a ritual. He prepared a seitan dough with
dozens of spices, precooked it and now it's under the smoker. Soon, it will be
roasted on the grill for the final touch.

What you get in the market, he said, is all fake. You have to do it yourself.
It's as cheap as flour, dead simple and the tastiest thing you'll ever eat.

Then they invited us for dinner.
