Often as a developer, the urge to create a blogging environment is bigger than
the discipline to run a blog. Although there is so much to share. And so -
again - I sit in front of an input, this time the Mastodon input field and make
a lot of plans. One post per day. English and German.

- Some speculative fiction.
- Some science fact.
- Some things about our environment and veganism
- Sometimes an image, an artwork or a photo.

Lately, I have abandoned the other social networks more and more. Most of them
run in passive mode for me. Reading, watching and listening. But here in this
still so small round, it might work. Can't promise though, not even to myself.
