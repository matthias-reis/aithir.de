The OpenAI project has recently released information about a project called
**Dall-E**. If you guess its purpose from the name, you might be right. A
mixture between Wall-E and Dali. You can describe an image with words to that AI
and it will precisely output what you've requested. Not by searching through a
database of existing stock imagery, but by producing it on the fly. And the
demos show that it's already extremely good at it.

So if it's already that good, how will it be in 2 or 3 years? Will it make
designers obsolete? Probably yes. But there is so much space to evolve to. My
old topic, the metaverse and the augmented reality business will offer endless
opportunities. But you designers will need a lot of flexibility - more than only
switching from Sketch to Figma.

Estimation: classic designers will be reduced by 60% in the next ten years.
Many, but not all will find good and interesting alternatives.
