Let's zoom in a bit more on my very own cyberpunk metaverse clone. So we've
learned that one sector has a length of 11.4 k. This area again is split into
256 x 256 so-called **areas**. Each around 44 x 44 u (meters) in size. With that
addition, the formal URLs are complete. Four additional hex digits now form the
full address like `@had.14D.00.1a`.

Just like today's IP addresses, these formal ones may have easy-to-remember
aliases. The most well-known one is e.g. `@root`, the global main entrance to
the mesh welcoming all newbies.

Each area is hosted on a dedicated server including all its 3d information.
Whenever your avatar moves around in the mesh, it is located in one of the
areas.

There is only one contract between areas. **6 u** in the exact middle of each
side of a square have to stay open to be able to move from one area to the next.
That's where usually streets go through.

Next up: how to navigate in the mesh.
