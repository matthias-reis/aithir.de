There is one more feature of magicians that is worth discussing.

Our perception of time is a subjective construct of our mind. It happens in our
brain and therefore it can be manipulated. Hermetics have that capability. No,
not what you think, as said, they can't go beyond physical laws. But they're
good manipulators and that includes the subjective impression of time passing
by. Who has never thought that in some situations time passes slower than in
others?

It is one of the easier tasks. Even weaker Hermetics can twist the time of their
surrounding fellows to a certain degree. As usual, a well-trained or more
powerful mage has better and more refined possibilities.

Slowing down the time for one person or a small group next to a magician is
doable even for stage 5 Hermetics. Almost stopping the time or restricting the
effect to only some individuums is already a greater task. Affecting a whole
town or region is the master class.
