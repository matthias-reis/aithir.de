When I start imagining a new world, it's comparable to a stream of water. It's
flowing, sometimes it hits a rock that must be softened, but most of the time,
it's flowing automatically - through the gravity of the original idea. If it
doesn't flow, the idea is not good enough.

Letting the water flow is the easy part for me. But just like puddles, from time
to time ideas of stories are forming in this world, that I want to explore. Some
of them turn out to be lakes, some are like oceans. But the small puddles are
interesting as well.

So I want to turn these small ideas into mini stories or anecdotes. The Mesh, my
virtual world cyberpunk universe is a good starting place for the first of these
little pieces.

I directly start with the logo. The mesh started off as a commercial project
from a consortium of five huge companies and got unleashed later. But from that
coop - other than the old internet - it inherited an iconic logo, the swoosh.

It was the first of its kind as it marked a change in the style of logos that
started off with rich, colourful brand marks and turned into reduced two
dimensional easy to recognize but hard to identify shapes.

The swoosh was the first that dissolved its shape and additionally had built in
animation and motion. Additionally, you could vaguely see an "M" in its shape.
Thus it's the ideal representation of the mesh.

Today, everyone sees this logo when starting a device that can enter the Mesh.
It is part of the night sky of the 3d world. and it shows up everywhere, where
places in the mesh are advertised. There is even a type of QR code that is
formed like the swoosh and indicates a Mesh location.

You can see this logo in the key visual of this storyline.
