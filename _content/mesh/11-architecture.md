Architecture in the Mesh Cyberspace is an essential ingredient. It has become
the most admired discipline amongst designers and produced buildings and cities
as diverse as the real world and beyond.

In theory, buildings are logistically restricted to an area (44 x 44 u) and have
a maximum height of 200 u to avoid superlative effects. And don't forget that
streets have to go through the middle of the area borders. Within these
parameters, the owner of an area has absolute freedom.

Only towards the largest spokes of the doughnut wheel, higher skyscrapers up to
1.000 u are allowed to compete with the gigantic column that spans into a
seemingly infinite sky.

Some designers have found ways to overcome these limits with tricks and
exceptional rules. For example, there are 6 beautiful sports stadiums that span
3 x 4 areas (170 x 130 u) consisting of 12 distinct buildings. If you look at
their construction in detail, you'd still see the rules applied.
