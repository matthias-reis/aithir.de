The Mesh has four centres on its outer equator - South, West, North and East.
The southern centre is `@root`, the default entry point if you log into the
Mesh. It is therefore the largest travelling hub. Most people enter here just to
directly transit through a portal to other destinations.

But there are also quite some attractions located around that spot - mainly for
the newbies and occasional surfers.

If you visit the mesh often - and that is the majority of over a billion users -
you most likely have a home base. This is a flat, an apartment or your own house
built somewhere in the vast regions of the mesh space. In case you have that,
you always respawn there after a new login.

For most people, the home base has much more functions than only an access
point. It's a central message hub and often has facilities to control other
things inside or outside the mesh from setting the indoor temperature to
organising your week.
