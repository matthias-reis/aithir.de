This storyline about veganism started with the climate crisis and already came
to its centre, animal rights. But there's one more field to cover: health. Let's
start with a part that is mentioned less often. Most of the recent pandemics are
caused by transmission paths that involve meat.

With today's hygiene standards, we can more or less exclude direct transmissions
as in the medieval plague. The only remaining vectors are mosquitos/insects with
malaria as an example. The rest of the pandemic incidents went through steps
that involve meat production and consumption with horrendously expensive side
effects.

Take corona as an example. The patient-0 transmission can be traced back pretty
precisely in the meantime. It can be located with a precision of five meters
around one spot on an open raw meat market (a so-called "wet market") in Wuhan,
China. The original carrier was a bat with probably another host (Tanukis are in
the discussion) in-between. All avoidable in a vegan world.
