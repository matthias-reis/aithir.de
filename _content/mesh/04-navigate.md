As mentioned, an avatar can travel between two areas by stepping over the 6 u
wide gap in the middle of each side of the area square. This happens more or
less without noticing.

But there is another way of reaching a certain area. You don't always have to
walk around the world. Every area is filled with streets and buildings and
public art and lights etc. One of these constructs is a portal. The owner of the
area is responsible for the look of that portal but there has to be one and it
follows some rules.

It's always a door - minimum 2 u high and 1 u wide. It is placed anywhere in the
area. And in eye height at 1.5 u there has to be a well-visible portal sign.
Other than that, portals are creative spaces for their architects. Some just
resemble backdoors or weird standalone objects, others are landmarks like the
pyramids.

You can step through the portal and then choose your destination and travel the
doughnut in an instant.
