The third group of dimensions after space and gravity form the time continuum.
The beautiful symmetry also gives us three of them.

However, we humans can only sense one. We live our lives on a timeline moving
permanently in one direction.

The theory says that the other dimensions contain alternate realities and form
the multiverse of possibilities. The timelines next to us contain a sequence of
events that are very similar to ours. Timelines further away are forming
different worlds.

However, it is technically not yet possible to prove that. Many scientists work
on gravity effects, some also concentrate on the time effects of the theory. But
there was no breakthrough yet. All of this remains theory for now.

But the theory says that time travel is more complex than imagined. Going back
in time means contaminating a timeline, which automatically forms another one.
So you simply can't go back into your own timeline.
