The tree was not hard to climb. Its bark texture was rough and she found grip
very easily. Still, it took a while and a short moment of vertigo until Lucy
reached the first branches of the crown that spanned above her like a giant
neo-gothic dome. When she found firm ground on a stable fork, she took a moment
of rest and looked around with amazement.

She checked her recording - still seeing the red dot in the corner, when she saw
something moving in the shadow on the other side of the natural plateau. Unsure
turning upward again, she even saw more things moving. The tree came to live.
She saw the first clear figure appearing next to her. It was a cat. A big one.
Streamlined, desert coloured with black tipped ears. Just like her own Cybergirl
avatar, the cat, the Caracal, had bionic metal parts on its body. Beautifully
crafted artwork.

Was she in danger? Was she under attack? That was her second thought while she
brought tension and readiness into her resting body again.
