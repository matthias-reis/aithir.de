The conquering of the galaxy. That's what we were striving for after the
discovery of the G-Tubes. At that time five big mining companies had already
been the lords of the solar system.

The first human transspace flight in a G25 vessel engineered by two of the
enclave participants, Wells & Bellman, was started just 3 years later. It took
them 7 hours to Mars and they reached 3% of lightspeed.

The most versatile drive was invented in the 2140s, around 45 years later. The
so-called Dublin drive was specified as G121 and took 16 h to Titan, the moon of
Saturn and an important outpost of Earth at that time.

Zodiac, one of the mining corporations found a specification for cargo and huge
ships at G1013 of G1k as it was then called. This drive was replaced only 21
years later by the G21k Starbase drive, which created the kickstart into
colonising the neighbour star systems. It took about 1 week per 10 light years.
