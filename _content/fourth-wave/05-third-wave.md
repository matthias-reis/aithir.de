The chain continued and most of the projects that planted seeds in our universe
have thrived. Especially the missions that found habitable planets grew rapidly
and are on the brink of finishing a successful terraforming process.

The third wave has anchored in the Procyon system and built their habitats in
shelter caves deep inside two suitable rocky planets. But also they could create
a balanced and well off society.

Caused by the circumstances, they became masters of the crafts they needed. They
build the most stable caves even in the oddest rock, they developed a beautiful
architecture style especially for their transparent structures outside those
caves and they are experts in geothermic power plants.

And now they are almost finished with their generation ships. As there are two
colonies, they've constructed two sister ships to balance the odds.
