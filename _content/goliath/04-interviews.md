In parallel, the capacity and processing power of Goliath grew. The team
prepared for the core learning method, a giant set of interviews.

The trainers had prepared interview rooms equipped with whiteboards, computer
interfaces, recording gear and a connection to Goliath. They planned half-hour
sessions of very different, diverse nature. Five in parallel, 24/7. That made
240 talks a day.

There was always an interviewer and a randomly chosen controller talking to
Goliath. They talked about topics from leisure and entertainment to astrophysics
and math. Some of the conversations were shallow small talk while others
resembled job interviews or interrogations. Over time, the interviewers also
came up with problems that had not been solved yet to seek actual advice or
inspiration from Goliath.

From time to time, they conducted a benchmark interview to assess the current
strength and attitude of the AI - a very elaborate Turing test.
