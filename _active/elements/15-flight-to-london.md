During the passage from Hamburg to Boulogne, Siobhan controlled the mics and was
in permanent exchange with Juliette and the other comms in Dublin. It turned out
that Siobhan knew their new guests already. They had been in contact before. The
radio community in Europe was small these days. After a day at sea, Siobhan and
Paul managed to make contact with Pierre.

So the company had another warm welcome when they arrived on the coast of
Northern France, probably the last wave of appreciation for a long time. Also,
Pierre and his crew had prepared one of the planes already and offered himself
as a pilot.

The plan was to get as near as possible to the crater. shoot photos and videos
and prepare for further steps. It seemed to become a habit to come together in a
cosy round for dinner before leaving. So also here in their third stop, they had
a nice evening before diving into yet another adventure.

On the next day, the plane to London was ready for the lift-off.
