It was a four-week research challenge for Lucy to find out the coordinates. She
had to go from forum over chat groups to bulletin boards and pages in a style
long forgotten. That part was an adventure on its own.

When she finally copied the address and looked it up in the map of the Mesh, she
was astonished. It was an end-of-the-world location in the middle of nothingness
with an abundance of pure and unterraformed landscapes around.

She took the day off for the trip, plugged in and pasted the coordinates. She
arrived in an old shed-like room. It was made out of wood and many rusty tools
and instruments hang on the walls.

After stepping out of that garage, she was a bit disappointed. There was no
tree. Just high grass till the horizon with some coloured sprinkles of flowers
in it. On the other side of the area, some 40 u away she saw another shed. It
looked like an exact copy. She walked there and saw the sign of a cicada on the
door.

She entered and found herself in a different world.
