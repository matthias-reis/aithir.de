When the Mesh and its predecessors had been introduced, the way how content was
created changed drastically. Before that, the web had consisted of semantic
text, most of the time dynamically controlled by software.

With the introduction of three-dimensional virtual realities, developers also
had to consider the space and the representation of their data in it.

The Mesh is still an open, decentral net. To allow a homogenous virtual
impression of such a heterogenous situation, they introduced a development
standard called UNO, **Unified Net Objects**.

This standard splits the 3d world into a huge tree of nodes that permanently
changes. Each node in there is represented by three characteristics: Its **look
and feel** including its relation to its children and parent nodes, its **data**
that it stores and the possibilities of how it could **interact** with data and
environment AKA the code.

In the next post, I'll dive a bit deeper.
