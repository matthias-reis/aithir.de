Hugo immediately looked through his things. What had been missing? What did that
guy steal? All he possessed, everything of value was virtual. The Mesh was his
home. This flat was just a necessity.

So he started cleaning up the mess. The single room was not very big, so it was
easy for the thief to mess up literally everything. Hugo folded his clothes that
were lying on the floor. He put back the three physical books he possessed -
among them his only piece of sentimental value. "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", a
gift from his mother. Then he put the tin plates and metal cups back into the
kitchen corner.

Nothing was broken, nothing was missing. So what was this all about? At least
one thing was clear. He had to invest some bucks into security equipment. First
thing tomorrow.

He sat on his chair and finally plugged into the mesh. In his home space on his
virtual desk, a light was blinking on the old fifties office telephone. A
message. From local. The thief must have planted it.
