Dark times, indeed. But what really threatens our existence concretely?

- **atomic war**: the probability is discussed daily. But the thresholds are
  presumably higher than our fear might tell us. Probability: 20%. Threatened:
  300 Million
- **pandemic**: Yes, it still exists. A more devastating corona variant or even
  a more dangerous new virus may come up. Probability: 30%. Threatened: 1
  Billion
- **climate crisis**: abstract, far away in the future and unnoticeably creeping
  into our world. Possible outcomes: 1. we are getting a grip on our consumption
  and becoming sustainable. 2. Somebody invents a CO2-eating bacteria that poop
  sugar. 3. we don't make it. Likelihood for 1: 20%, for 2: 50%. Remaining: 30%,
  Threatened: 4 Billion
- **AI**: The technical progress is immense. Some day in the near future, there
  will be a computer that is simply superior. And then we can only hope that
  this machine shows mercy. Probability: 10%. Threatened: Everyone.
