Udin found a stone. At first, it was fully covered with dirt. She only saw its
beauty and quality because a small corner stood out. So she went to the river
and cleaned it up. It was the most beautiful piece, she had ever seen. It had a
perfect form. Except for a light blue shine, it was transparent and it had
engravings on each side.

She gave it to her father Kules, who was the leader of their tribe. The artefact
was so extraordinary and mysterious, it had to come from the gods themselves. So
the tribe started to worship the stone. The women cpoied the stone ornaments for
their own jewellery and made amulets that were supposed to protect their warrior
husbands from large animals and rival tribes.

The stone itself, however, remained for generations in the possession of the
tribe leader and nourished their power through its cult.

With power came envy. A century later, a riot started and the tribe became
extinct in fight for the stone. The artefact got lost again.
