A problem that I have with the climate catastrophe lies in the magnitudes of
numbers. When someone says "this emits 5 kg of CO₂ equivalent", what does that
mean? It's totally abstract.

So I think, we should make it more concrete. When the IPCC, the main
organisation that tracks climate change, released their reposts, they came up
with a budget that we have if we want to stay below the 1.5°C. It's 420 Billion
tons. For the world in 30 years.

Divided by 30 and the average expected population of 8,73 billion people, this
makes 1,6 tons per year for every one of us. This is my new reference.

What we actually emit:

- Germany: **539%**
- China: **536%** (astonishing, right?)
- USA: **1.091%**
- World average: **400%**

In comparison:

- the german forest absorbs (-) **46,4%**
- Flight Hamburg - Malaga (Spain) **48,1%** (by train: **4,9%**)
- Flight Hamburg - Sydney **675%**
- Niederaußem (a single lignite power plant) **12,5%** (per capita)
