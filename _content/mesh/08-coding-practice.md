Writing programs for the Mesh is more complicated and fuzzy than in previous
versions of the internet.

In former times, coding was precise. A developer controlled every single pixel
and every interaction. But the surface of a 3D world is much bigger than
browsers. The Mesh can be entered with devices from watches to immersive suits.
Each of them comes with different ways of interacting with the Mesh space.

Therefore a good part of the interaction between different objects in the Mesh
is controlled by the Mesh itself. Developers could do, but rarely do detailed
motion studies to tweak micro movement curves. That is the realm of AI. Aspects
like facial expressions or body gestures are derived from live or trained video
footage.

So developers and designers are plumbing the pieces together. Additionally,
there are huge libraries of basics to choose from. They can concentrate on the
20% that make the difference.
