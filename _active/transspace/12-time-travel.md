The last chapter of this worldbuilding exercise focuses on things not invented
yet. Let's go back to [time travelling](/storylines/transspace/05-time). Even
100 years after the enclave, scientists have no practical clue how to do it,
although some groups have worked on it since the beginning.

The current state of the art speaks of two devices. The first is a temporal
converter (or Verter). It allows to slide along the regular time axis into the
future and the past. The other one is called temporal polarizer (or Poler). This
allows going from one timeline to another. It can find your own home timeline
again.

Both devices have been confirmed by theories and micro experiments. But on a
large scale, their complexity exceeds the capacities in the known space. The
universe could prevent a paradox just by making it too complicated to execute.

This marks the end of the storyline. So who wants to dive into the first
missions now? It's time to meet some (well known) aliens, isn't it?
