## Who am I?

My name is Matthias, I am a Software Engineer and Team Lead. But since I was a
teen, I have been thinking of stories and built other worlds in my head. Later,
I have written them down, forgot them, found them again, added layers of ideas
to it and so on. I am 48 now and still, from time to time, I have ideas popping
up. So there's plenty of material.

## What should I do with all that?

Some years ago, one of these ideas grew so large that it had to be channeled
into a novel, that I have really written and published together with my beloved
wife. It is a fantasy novel written in German and called "Die Hermetiker".

But with the many other stories (ranging from space opera over cyberpunk to
researched science facts), I haven't found a suitable channel yet. I've tried
many formats. As a developer, it's so easy to get lost in creating the best
possible blog and forgetting about the content. And so I've tried many variants
all bound to conditions like at least one complete article per week. And I never
managed to deliver that much and lost track after a while.

## What now?

And then came the Twitter crisis. Elon Musk was supposed to buy Twitter. And we
tried out other things like [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@aithir). This was
the opportunity for a reboot and the creation of a purposeful account.

The format was given. Maximum was 1.000 characters per toot. So I sliced my
conten into small 150-word-pieces and published the stuff in series that I
called [storylines](/storylines).

And because you might lose the overview after some time, I came back to the
original plan of creating a website for it. But this time with the difference
that there is quite some content already.

And there is a routine pace of **four contributions per week**. Amazing. And not
even enough when I look at my pleasure to write and compress words and create a
little bit of suspense every day.

## Nitty Gritty

Want some facts about the portal? I'm using **Next.JS** and deploy everything on
**Vercel**. For now, I'm even on the free tier. But if traffic rises, I'd love
to pay some cents for the maintenance. The minimal and bespoke tracking is done
via Mixpanel (I wanted to move away from Google Analytics).

Every storyline comes with its own signature image and colour. Most of the
images come from **unsplash**. The content layout is roughly inspired by the
german designer Dieter Rams and uses "Helvetica Neue" - overused in the past and
underrated nowadays.

## Have Fun

The first purpose of my texts is to entertain myself during writing. But I also
appreciate feedback and discussion. How do you like it? Would you want something
changed? Are you curious of what is coming next?

I'd love to hear your thoughts. You can [mail me](mailto:mr@octahedron.world),
or reach me via [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@aithir),

But of coures, I als want you to have some fun with my
texts.[ Why don't you dive into them?](/) They are only 30-second reads.
