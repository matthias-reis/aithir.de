As previously described, the life of all Kret is taking place inside their
Arras, their families. However, there is one caste that lives outside these
structures. The judges or in the Kret language, the "**Kane**" (singular
**Kano**).

Kane enjoy a high reputation within all ranks and hierarchies of the Kret
society. They are completely neutral and don't interfere in any way with the
daily business of Arras. They monitor each other with a complex system of
overlapping responsibilities and territories. So corruption exists but its
countermeasures are strong.

Next to the judges themselves, there is a full administrative infrastructure
that takes care of their supply of daily goods, organizational tasks and even
entertainment. The caste of the Kane is a world on its own.

Once a month there is a conference where the high council Kalam Mas and the
supreme judges (Kane Kane) come together for a mutual exchange.
