It is late October 1904. My name is Camil Constantin. I am a chronist at the
Kronstadt registry and this is aggregation report number 411-1904-101. My
assignment lies in gathering all available information about the "Drac
Incidents" that took place more than 400 years ago.

My work involves a journey to Schäßburg, where the registry of Kronstadt
maintains an outpost. I am writing this from the coach that is supposed to bring
me to the local registry. It is my third day in this torturing vehicle, it is
raining all the time and we have to make many stops. A gathering with the local
director is setup for tomorrow.

The Drac Incidents are events that we classify as type D. The Hermetic Society
must under no circumstances be known among the public. Type D cases are larger
breaches of this rule. I have the honour to follow up on one of the most famous
of them. Unfortunately, the latest developments demand a thorough reappraisal.
