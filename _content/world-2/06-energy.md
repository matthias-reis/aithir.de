#World2 - Energy

Energy consumption and management is the third train of thought, I want to talk
about in this series.

Energy, on the one hand, is by far the biggest driver of the climate crisis. On
the other hand, the world in central Europe faces another crisis fired by heat
and drought and by the war in Ukraine and our dependency on Russian gas and oil.

For the climate, the complex topic splits up into four interdependent areas:

- electricity (43%)
- industrial consumption (24%)
- traffic (21%)
- heating (12%)

More detailed numbers with sources will follow. This touches only the energy
part, the whole climate crisis is much more complex because it entails other
more efficient greenhouse gases, deforestation and tipping points.

I have the feeling that I have to increase the frequency of these posts because
every day something new happens in that sector and I need to get behind that. So
much for the shortkick start into the energy topic.
