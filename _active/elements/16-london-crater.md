Besides Ruth and Pierre, who jumped in as the pilot, nobody had been flying
before. The Theologist would have been old enough, but at a younger age, he was
too afraid. Today, he still had some respect and he talked all the time. But
also the others had a paler skin tone than normal while sitting in the little
Cessna machine.

After the lift-off, the Theologist puked. Everything else went well. The first
view was breathtaking. The flight was supposed to take an hour. It was an hour
of almost total silence.

They were high up in the air when they saw the gigantic lake in London's east.
From that height, Ruth couldn't grasp much detail, but the cameras on the plane
worked well. Pierre steered the machine down to take recordings as detailed as
possible.

None of the buildings was intact as they flew over Covent Garden and Soho to
approach the shore of the lake, which looked even bigger from a height of 100 m.
Ruth knew that London was destroyed. But seeing this is a different thing.
