We already know that the Mesh is a giant doughnut, But I want to give you some
more details.

The Builders wanted to introduce as many different sceneries as possible. So the
doughnut is rotating around one axis in a daily cycle and around the symmetrical
centre in a yearly cycle and it's illuminated by a giant sun from one side. This
creates the effect of day and night and sometimes even a tube eclipse.

In addition, it has four spokes on the inside and in the centre of it all, there
is a spherical core. The spokes are small compared to the diameter of the
doughnut tube but gigantic when you stand right in front of one of the sockets.
All of this central construction contains the management and controlling
facilities to run the mesh - from teleportation logic to search engines.
Companies who build infrastructure to run the mesh have their facilities inside
a spoke or even in the core sphere.
