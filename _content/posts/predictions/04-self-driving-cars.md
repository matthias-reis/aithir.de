Traffic is terrible, Jams are annoying, Construction sites are from hell and I
don't even want to start with the other drivers. I've made a
[full storyline](/storylines/traffic) out of it. If only cars could drive on
their own. Let's look at the situation in ten years.

Right now, we already have working systems of self-driving cars. Complex AI is
making more objective and a hundred times faster decisions. And it's just the
beginning, the advent of AI. Things are improving daily and these systems - if
used by the masses - could increase their learning dataset by many orders of
magnitude as soon as the cars get on the streets.

My prediction for 2033: We will have the technical break-even. These driving
robots will be more reliable, more energy-efficient and less involved in
accidents than human drivers. But especially in Germany, I can see many
opponents that want to keep their freedom. So in ten years, this will not yet be
the standard. Probably in 15, though. We'll see.
