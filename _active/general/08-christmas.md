Hello there! I think, it's time for a special post. It's the last post before
Christmas. And it arrives after the shortest day of the year. So from now on,
the world is getting brighter day by day again. I wish you all the best and a
nice and calm holiday time.

I myself have some new things in the planning and want to add another little
twist to my posts. On Monday, a new storyline for children starts and I have two
more in preparation that will start a few weeks later. It's going to be
fantastic, I can promise. And this time, I will also deliver the german
translation. The main reason is that these posts have very specific recipients.

Christmas is a Christian holiday, but the overall mood around that time is
somewhat typical to all people in the northern hemisphere. I think it's
generally good to take some days from time to time to calm down, eat more than
you work, reflect on the past and make good wishes about the future.

I wish you all a beautiful time!
