The media called the objects **Alien** from the beginning and everyone who saw
the pictures immediately had the same thoughts.

On an August day, Earth was visited by 61 spheres. All of them arrived
simultaneously visiting all continents. There was visual footage of 35 of them
and it ran through all the news shows on the same day.

As they always do, the so-called experts analyzed every single bit of that
visit. The diameter of each of the identical spheres was around 18m. Their visit
took 2 hours 20 minutes and they really were absolutely synchronous to the
second. Metallurgs speculated about the surface material, aerodynamicists about
the turbulence around the UFOs while physicists seemed to know how they were
moving, where the power came from and how they had come here.

But it was only three weeks later when the authorities and investigators found
out that 122 people, two in each region where the spheres had been sighted, had
gone missing.
