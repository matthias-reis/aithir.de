Goliath, the AI was a promising project after all. Over time, they released some
of the neural networks spawned by the core as dedicated programs for public
usage or better for profit. Three years after the routine operation had started,
the project paid off itself through investments of states, suggested economic
optimizations and product spin-offs.

That's where the next phase started. The engineers added an array of eight
quantum computer cores, which expanded the horizon of Goliath's capabilities by
orders of magnitude. From decryption over reverse engineering to real-time
visualization, every feature of the AI passed former boundaries and tipping
points.

At that time, the system could produce a photorealistic movie in almost
real-time or write stunning symphonies and analyze money streams of a whole
continent while the other slots for interviews and side tasks still stayed open.
