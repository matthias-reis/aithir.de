The following weeks brought inflation of knowledge. The probes on the surface of
Rana 3 worked perfectly. The translator AI learned the new languages within a
week. In the same week, the crew gathered geographical and sociological data.
After that, the working teams augmented their observations with statements from
the aliens.

They learned that they called themselves the Kret. Martin was concentrated.
Within three weeks, he and his team had to learn about the Krets' history,
preferences and habits. Those were the remaining bits that went into the grand
plan to get in contact.

All the rest was already worked out on Earth and during the long trip. Which
landing place they would choose, which people they would pick, all of that was
well known. But the things that mattered most, what he would say, was Martins's
decision alone. A truly giant leap for mankind, but also himself.

Now, a team of seven was sitting in a shuttle waiting to be transported to the
first contact.
