The human body defines itself by a trinity of properties. Firstly, **physical
strength**, muscle power, stamina and mobility. Secondly, the **intellectual
capabilities** of the brain. And thirdly, the **spiritual power** represented by
the mana. All three are separated from each other but they also interact.
Influencing someone's astral body affects them just like a hit in the face does.

The astral body is wrapped by a halo called "**aura**". If somebody wants to
enter someone else's mind, they have to pass through the opponent's aura. The
aura can be compared to encryption. The stronger it is, the more difficult it is
to get to the data. Stronger Hermetics can build up a perfect shield while
regular people might be defenseless.

A well-trained Hermetic can let their astral body free for a virtual trip. While
this is an extremely powerful feature, it also makes them vulnerable as the
astral body leaves the guarding aura behind.
