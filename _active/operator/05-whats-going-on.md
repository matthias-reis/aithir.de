"She's gone. They have her. What should I do? This is so fucked up. What's going
on?" `B055` had a complete breakdown. He had called Hana into their office space
in the mesh and didn't stop talking nonsense since she had arrived. She still
couldn't understand a word. He needed a slap in his digital face.

She opened the console and typed. Then a noise was induced into `B055`'s ears.
After a short gesture of horror, his voice stopped and he started breathing
heavily.

"`B055`, hey", she adressed him. "What is going on? Talk slowly and in full
sentences!"

After some more seconds of breathing, he finally started. "Someone has kidnapped
Adele. They broke into my flat and left me a message."

Now Hana broke down as well, but she had to keep the rollercoaster on the
inside.

"Who are they? What do they want?", she asked.

"I don't know who. They come back with more. They left me the coordinates of a
message box. Adele is off the grid, `R00t`. She's not traceable and I can't
reach her."
