The climate discussion is finally leading the news headlines everywhere. This is
actually a good thing. It starts to get into the minds of people. That's what
the movement needed. All of it was predicted 50 years ago already.

But now it's not only theory anymore. The news are full of real effects caused
by the climate change. We have (now officially) the largest fires ever in
Europe. Greece is the winner for now. We have century floods in Germany only
some hundred kilometers away from draught and water shortage.

How will this look like in ten years? First we have to know that nothing we do
or start doing now will stop that direction in such a short time. So the
disasters will stay. They will even be bigger and more often. And the first
areas in the world will become permnently damaged and uninhabitable.

So the impact on the society will become more direct. We will spend more money
to repair whole damaged landscapes. And we will see governments fall apart and
[whole nations on the move](/posts/predictions/03-climate-refugees).

But on the other hand, the topic will also wear down. Nobody will write about
century floods anymore when we see one in the news every month. Remember the
Ukrainian war? It's still ongoing, but it's just not that often in the news
anymore. The same happened with other incidents in the past. So climate
catastrophes will also become an everyday topic in Europe. We will get used to
it, we will just put more effort in keeping the others who really suffer out of
our comfortable home lands.

But at least, we finally do something against the cause and will work on our COâ‚‚
emissions.
