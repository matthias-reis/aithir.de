The Hermetic Society plays an important role in the life of every registered
magician. We will surely get into much more detail regarding this.

But one main duty of the Society is to monitor and enforce ethical guidelines.
In the last post, we learned, that Hermetics can enter and influence the mind of
others. Passing through the guarding Aura of another person is obviously
considered very intrusive and of course, can lead to massive abuse that must be
prevented.

The rule is simple. It is forbidden to cross others' aura. But its enforcement
is as complicated as the proof of other abuses.

The Hermetic Society, therefore, has established an independent council called
"**the Observers**". They are as independent as regular courts in normal
society, but they also have an attached intelligence service, which is almost as
powerful and spooky as Big Brother.

The Hermetic Society has not survived aeons by being the good guys.
