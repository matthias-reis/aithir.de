We know that the Kret are physically very similar to us and that they
genetically have a 100.000-year-old history. But they have missed some of the
tipping points of social development, that had led to this explosive exponential
growth of us humans.

Studies from sociologists point to their social relations and the lack of larger
entities that would foster such massive infrastructural efforts needed for
exponential development.

All other aspects of their life point to a culturally rich history that dates
back to civilizations at least twice as old as the first human ones. Especially
there are also no signs of large-scale disruptions like wars or pandemics.

Their craftsmanship and their understanding of arts for example are way ahead of
ours. Their knowledge and capabilities in the field of mechanics and their
insights into mathematics are extraordinary.
