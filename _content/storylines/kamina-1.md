Kamina ran as fast as she could. She was furious. Because she had been arguing
with her brother again. He had taken away her beautiful music box. When it was
opened, a little unicorn danced to a charming melody, the name of which she had
unfortunately forgotten. The colorful wooden box with the dancing unicorn was
the dearest thing she owned.

Yoko, her brother, was two years older than her. He had taken the watch from her
before. She remembered exactly. It had been on her last birthday, when she
turned six. Yoko had even broken off a small corner of the dainty box with the
dancing unicorn inside. This time she was prepared. She immediately snatched the
watch out of his hand, kicked him in the shin, and ran off as fast as she could.
That served him well!

You have just been on holiday at a campsite by the sea. Actually, the
six‐year‐old liked it here very much. Everything was green and covered with
bushes. What she particularly liked was that there were holes everywhere where
rabbits lived. She had already encountered them twice this year.

Whenever it was nice, her brother has to come and destroy everything. It was
exactly the same on her birthday. In anger, the girl ran on and on. In the
meantime they had already left behind two of the long dark hedges that grew here
between the meadows. She passed the last tents on the edge of the campsite.

She had almost reached the stairs leading down to the beach when she saw someone
hopping on the floor in front of her. It was one of the rabbits. It must have
been particularly trusting, for Kamina had never come so close to any of them.
Although her footsteps made quite a noise, she didn't seem to be afraid of her
at all. The girl paused for a moment to pause.

She decided to sneak carefully from now on in order to be able to get a little
closer to the little animal. She just wanted to pet it too much. It hopped away
and finally stopped in front of the next hedge. Kamina was puzzled. The rabbit
seemed to be waiting for them.

The shrubs in the hedges were so thorny and dense that you couldn't just squeeze
through. However, the animals that lived here had made sure that there were a
few beaten paths. Kamina knew her pretty well by now. This is your third time
here.

Where the rabbit was now sitting, a passage had formed from the roots and
branches of the hedge. It almost looked like a small door.

"The perfect entrance to a rabbit hole," Kamina thought to herself. Or had she
said it? She wasn't quite sure. And what was even stranger: the rabbit had
answered her! Or had she misheard? Now the rodent repeated its words.

"Come with me!" it said loud and clear. "Yes, you there. You and your friend,"
the rabbit added.

"What friend?" replied Kamina, perplexed. She couldn't believe she was talking
to a rabbit. Until now, she had only known something like this from stories. At
that moment, there was also a knock.

"Knock, knock" - What could that be again? That's when she noticed that the
knocking sounds were coming from her music box. She opened the lid of the wooden
box, but this time no music came out. Of course, her brother immediately came
back to her mind.

"This time he broke my watch for good," she thought. But then she heard another
voice.

"Hello Kamina, I'm Flox," it sounded softly in Kamina's ears. She couldn't
believe her eyes. The voice seemed to come from the little unicorn in the clock.

"You're alive and you can talk?" Kamina asked in a trembling tone. She was
overwhelmed. First a rabbit talked to her and now her favorite toy.

"Yes, Kamina. I'm here to take care of you."

"But, but." Kamina faltered. All of a sudden, she had so many questions. "But
how can that be?"

"I've always taken care of you, my darling," said the colorful unicorn. "And I
can do a lot more than just talk. Watch out."

With these words, the horse reared up briefly. His fur glistened and his horn
began to glow in all the colors of the rainbow. Then, suddenly, it seemed to get
bigger and bigger. Kamina felt dizzy as she watched.

Suddenly, she noticed something even stranger: the unicorn wasn't growing at
all. She herself was getting smaller and smaller. At some point, she was barely
bigger than the rabbit. The next moment she was already passing through the
passage through which it had come out of the hedge. The unicorn was now standing
beside her. It was the size of a small pony, but with the graceful elegance of a
noble white horse.

"Well, what do you think, Kamina?" said Flox. The unicorn's voice sounded much
deeper and stronger now than the first time.

"It scares me a little," Kamina replied. "You made me small. How am I ever going
to get out of here?"

"Don't be afraid, Kamina," Flox reassured the girl. "I'm always there for you. I
promise you that nothing will happen to you and that you will be back in time
for lunch."

"You know, we need your help," Flox added as they walked down a shady, narrow
passageway among the thorny bushes. "The mermaids are in danger."

"The mermaids?" asked Kamina, dumbfounded.

Kamina had always dreamed of mermaids when they were here on vacation. So they
really seemed to exist? Judging by the crazy things that had already happened to
her today, that had to be true, of course. She couldn't believe her luck. She
might meet some real mermaids soon.

Flox began to talk about the inhabitants of the sea. He reported on the
conversations that the colorful fish had with each other. Of the turtles and the
big whales. Finally, he told of Queen Neptunia the Second. That was the name of
the ruler of the water spirits and mermaids.

After a long walk with many bends and turns, and over steps carved into the
cliff rocks, they reached the sea. The water splashed in small glittering waves
against the bright sandy beach.

Kamina had the feeling that they had been on the road for a very long time. When
she looked up, she had to rub her eyes. She almost couldn't believe what she saw
in front of her in the bright sunlight.

The three hikers found themselves in the middle of a shimmering pink sea.
Thousands of flamingos stood row after row in the shallow water. They pecked at
fish and plucked their feathers.

One of the front rows had a strange hat on his head. It looked like a helmet,
but it seemed to be made of some kind of leather. In addition, the bird wore
glasses on its forehead. I guess he didn't need them right now. Kamina thought
that maybe the animal put them on so that insects wouldn't fly into its eyes as
it flew.

"What a weird flamingo," she thought. As if she had asked him about it, he spoke
to her.

"My name is River. I am the guardian of the great sea city, and these are my
guards. Who are you and what do you want?" he added in 11 imperious tones.

Since they had shrunk, the waterfowl was more than three times the size of the
child. Flox nudged Kamina with his nostrils. At the same time, the unicorn was
asking her to say something and making her understand that it was still keeping
him safe.

"My name is Kamina Sommerspitz," she stuttered.

"And I'm Flox," the unicorn quickly added. "We are already awaited by Queen
Neptunia, the Second. We're here to offer our help."

"Is that so?" River replied incredulously. "So that's you?"

He made some strange head movements to the second flamingo behind him. He
immediately leaned back with his long neck and whispered something in the ear of
one of the other birds. And so it went on. Through the silent mail, the news
soon reached the farthest flamingos and the game turned around. After a few
seconds of awkward silence, the second finally leaned over to River and
whispered an answer to him.

"You're allowed to pass," he said after a moment's thought. The flock of
flamingos split in the middle, clearing a path that led directly into the sea.

"Don't worry," Flox said to Kamina. "If I or one of the water spirits is around,
you can breathe normally underwater."

For a brief moment, Kamina was overcome with fear again. She couldn't help but
think of her parents and the time that had passed since she had spotted the
rabbit upstairs. It had to be quite late. Surely lunch had already begun. I'm
sure her family was already worried.

But she decided to be brave. What was happening here was just too exciting.
There was no way she could miss this adventure.

So she took her first steps into the sea. Surprisingly, the water didn't seem
cold at all. If they had gone swimming here until now, it had always taken quite
a long time before she had dared to go all the way in.

On the way to the sea city, Flox and River, who accompanied her, told the girl
about the problems in the underwater world.

"More and more plastic waste is accumulating in the houses and caves of the
water spirits," Flox explained. "The bags and bottles and fishing nets are a
great danger. Last week, even the tower in the city center collapsed. A net just
wrapped itself around him and he was swept away by the current."

"But what can I do?" asked Kamina, who really wanted to help.

"Queen Neptunia will tell you," River replied. His voice sounded muffled because
his head was still above water. Kamina could only see his red legs at the
moment. The flamingo only dipped its head under it sometimes to check on them.

Only then did she notice that the rabbit was no longer there. It had followed
them to the beach. Now it seemed to have run back to its burrow. Funny. Kamina
hadn't even noticed how it had gone. Would she hit it again? She would have
liked to talk to him a little longer. After all, it was her favorite animal that
lived in her favorite place.

The adventurers were now standing in front of a mighty wooden gate. It was
magnificently decorated and painted in all the colors of the sea. River dived
under one more dive and tapped the gate three times with his beak. The gate
opened slowly. They entered the kingdom of the water spirits.

Kamina was astonished. They were standing at the entrance of a huge city.
Hundreds of mermaids were buzzing around everywhere. With their long fish fins,
they were the best swimmers she had ever seen.

Adults and children swam behind each other, next to and on top of each other.
They went about their business. Some of the children had toys with them, just
like her. Kamina was thrilled. Immediately, she, too, tried to dive around so
happily. But she soon realized that she couldn't be quite as fast and agile with
her human legs - although she wasn't as clumsy as she thought. Mrs. Pütz, your
swimming instructor would certainly have been proud of her.

After the short time she was now under the surface of the water, it worked out
perfectly with the locomotion. Poor Flox continued to trot along the ground. You
could see that this wasn't his world. Suddenly, Kamina saw a group of four young
mermaids swimming towards her.

"Hello, who are you?" the first child whispered somewhat dismissively.

"I'm Neria," a greenish mermaid chimed in in a much more polite tone. She must
have noticed that the girl was a bit intimidated.

"This is my sister Xiope and my brother Filipe. My brother Merlin over here has
already greeted you."

"Hello," Kamina whispered. Her breath caught with admiration. "My name is
Kamina, Kamina Sommerspitz. I'm a human being and I was brought here by my
friend Flox." Kamina gestured to the rear.

Under water, you can't make as much progress on the ground, so the unicorn was
still a bit away.

"Oh, good old Flox," Neria said.

"You already know him?" asked Kamina, surprised.

"Yes, of course! Everyone here knows Flox. He has helped us so many times. He's
also a good friend of our mother."

"Oh, that's right! I've only known him for a few hours, even though he's been
living in my music box for a few years."

"What? I don't understand. You'll have to tell me more about that soon. But for
now, let's talk about us. We are four siblings, as you already know. Our mother
is the queen here."

It seemed important to the mermaid to introduce them all.

"Ah," said Kamina. "Queen Neptunia is your mother?"

"Yes, exactly! We are all water spirits. Also called mermaids, or mermaids. But
that's a very old-fashioned term. We like ghosts better. That sounds a lot
wilder. How do you know our mother?"

"Flox and River, the flamingo, told me about her on the way here. I think they
want to take me to her."

Kamina told her story. She tries to summarize everything that had happened to
her so far on that strange day. She got along so well with the four water
spirits that she lost track of time and immersed herself in the games and
stories they had in store.

Eventually, Flox appeared behind them. One of the adult water spirits was also
there.

"Kamina, where have you been for so long," Flox neighed, who was quite out of
breath. "I've been looking for you for ages. We wanted to see the queen. Don't
forget your task, my darling!"

Kamina had a guilty conscience. Of course, the task! How could she forget them?
She wanted to go on an adventure and help the inhabitants of the sea with their
problem with plastic waste.

"Come on, we'll go with you," Neria suggested without further ado. "Let's pay
Mom a visit. I'm sure she doesn't mind," she told her siblings.

And so the group of six made their way to the Royal Palace in the middle of the
city. On the way there, they also passed a pile of rubble.

"This is where the big tower stood," Neria said. Kamina got a real fright. It
was a sad sight.

The magnificent houses of the underwater city quickly calmed her down. They were
even more beautiful than she had imagined. The girl was especially enthusiastic
about the queen's grand palace. When they reached him, their eyes were shining.
She had never in her life seen such a magnificently sparkling mansion as the
Underwater Palace.

"This is where we live," Neria said.

"Awesome," Kamina marveled. They were now accompanied by the palace guards.

"I'll never find my way back on my own," Kamina thought. They had swum through a
maze of corridors, halls, and adjoining rooms, and had just arrived at the
queen's throne room. The path through the palace and the alleys of the
underwater city back to the beach and through the bushes to the campsite seemed
insurmountable to her at that moment.

But she quickly forgot those thoughts. Their surroundings were just too
beautiful to worry about. The hall was so big that she could have fit in even
her normal size without hitting her head.

"Come closer," she heard a warm, pleasant voice echo from the other side of the
room. The echo bounced off all the walls.

Kamina took a few steps in the direction from which she had heard the words. As
she approached, she saw a woman with short white hair sitting on the throne. It
had to be Queen Neptunia, Nerias, Xiope, Filipe, and Merlin's mother. She looked
like a real majesty. Kamina could already see it in her posture. She was
beautiful and her age could only be guessed at. She had long, white hair, which
was held in place by a fine coral headband. She wore a white robe, from which
the magnificent caudal fin, shimmering in all shades of blue and green, peeked
out.

"Hello Mom," the cheeky Merlin called. He had already swum ahead.

"Well, who did you bring me?" asked the Queen in a motherly tone. It wasn't
until the group got closer that Neptunia was able to see the straggler.

"Flox, my old friend," she greeted the unicorn enthusiastically. She rose from
her throne and swam to meet him. "It's a great pleasure to see you!"

The two whispered a little to each other. Kamina couldn't understand what they
were saying. Eventually, they approached her as well.

"That's Kamina, Kamina Sommerspitz from the people," Flox introduced her. In a
fairy tale movie, Kamina had once seen that people made a curtsy when they met a
queen. Of course, this wasn't a fairy tale, but she thought it was the right
thing to do. The queen began to laugh.

"We have been refraining from such polite phrases down here for many millennia.
Do they still do that with you humans up there? A Knix? It's best to just come
here. I welcome you to my castle! I see you've already met my children? I
suppose they've already shown you around?"

"Yes," Kamina answered. "They are very nice to me."

"I am glad to hear that, my dear," replied the Queen. "Flox has already told me
a lot about you."

Kamina looked at the unicorn, who nodded his head reassuringly and
affirmatively.

"Only the best," Flox neighed softly.

"I don't know if I can help you," Kamina finally blurted out. She'd wanted to
ask them all along.

"Hahaha," the queen laughed in her friendly and funny way. "And if you can,
Kamina!" she answered. "You have the gift of it. Flox told me weeks ago and now
I see it with my own eyes. You just have to believe in yourself. Come with me, I
have something to show you."

Without hesitation, Queen Neptunia took Kamina aside. They swam to a quieter
side of the room and sat down on a bench made of shells. Flox followed them. The
young water spirits continued to play in front of their mother's throne. They
had discovered a few toys there, which they must have left there on their last
visit to the hall.

"Think of any toy," said the Queen.

Kamina couldn't think of anything else but her brother's old beach ball.
Suddenly, he landed right in her lap. She looked around, startled, and searched
the corners for her brother. But there was nothing to see.

"Try again. Take a piece of jewelry this time."

With these words, Queen Neptunia took the ball from the girl and let it rise
towards the ceiling with a powerful jerk. Kamina felt something cold around her
neck and recognized the silver chain with the small amulet in which the pictures
of her parents were tucked. Although she was sure she hadn't even taken it with
her on vacation, suddenly it was here.

"How do you do that?" she asked the queen in astonishment.

"Oh, I don't do anything," Neptunia replied. "It's all coming from you. You
carry the rare gift of imagination within you. You can make things come true
from your thoughts. You've always been able to do it, but the older you get, the
better you'll be able to concentrate and the better it will work."

"Flox has already shown you what has happened to our beautiful city. The large
tower, which once rose to the surface of the sea, has recently collapsed. He got
caught in a huge fishing net. But that's only a small part of the problem. The
whole city is struggling with people's plastic waste. The fish outside our city
walls and the whole beach are also affected. In fact, some of us water spirits
and many other sea creatures have died from it."

Kamina was affected. She desperately needed to protect this beautiful world she
had just discovered. It could not be lost.

"All the residents of the city are ready to help. But we still need more
protection. You can help us with your imagination. The task is simple and
complicated at the same time. Come up with something that keeps the garbage out
of our city, but doesn't harm the inhabitants of the sea. We've tried nets
before, but unfortunately fish got caught in them. It was too dangerous for us."

Kamina closed her eyes and thought. She couldn't help but think of her dolls.
She had a very special doll that could grasp with her hands. In addition, she
had recently been given a small excavator that could extend its gripper arm. Her
imagination worked like never before. She thought of the doll's arms fishing the
trash out of the current. Flox and the Queen watched Kamina. They both smiled.
It almost looked as if they could see what was going on in the six-year-old's
head. When Kamina opened her eyes again, she told them about her idea.

When they all swam back outside together, the whole city was already on its way.
Everyone wanted to lend a hand and free the underwater world and the beach from
garbage. Kamina swam with Neria, Queen Neptunia, Felipe, Xiope, Merlin, and some
of the guards to the outskirts of the city.

They were in the ocean current and were not so easy to reach. In order to keep
up with the pace of the sea creatures, she was allowed to ride a large Napoleon
fish together with the unicorn. This was a lot of fun and Kamina squealed a few
times with joy.

She didn't even think about the time anymore. She much preferred to think about
all the things she wanted to build to help the creatures underwater.

The Napoleon fish set them down on a flat rock. Once there, Kamina closed his
eyes again and continued to think. Neria and the others stood beside her,
amazed.

Among all the helpers from the city who were diving around and picking up
garbage, large, encrusted arms suddenly appeared out of nowhere like moray eels
from the bottom of the sea. There were strong hands on them that could grasp
anything, no matter how heavy it was. They kept reaching for nets, plastic
bottles and bags. They even snatched an old piece of a ship from the sea.

Over time, there were more and more poor people. There were so many of them, and
they were so long and strong that they could reach the whole underwater city and
the entire beach. The gripper arms worked faster and faster. The mountain of
garbage grew.

After everything was clean, Kamina was exhausted. Flox noticed and took care of
the brave girl. The unicorn called for departure and so everyone made their way
back to the sea city.

Kamina was truly surprised when they passed the huge mountain of garbage on the
beach that her fantastic gripper arms had piled up. She quickly realized that he
couldn't stay here like this, and so she remembered with the last of her
strength a hairy, orange caterpillar she had once seen. The little creature had
been very voracious and had eaten a very large, green leaf before her eyes.

She closed her eyes once more, and a moment later, a huge horde of hungry
caterpillars scrambled over the mountain to devour it with great appetite. When
the caterpillars had eaten everything, it became very quiet around them. Their
color changed. A rich orange turned dark brown and her previously shiny coat
disappeared. Instead, they were now covered in a leathery skin. They had
pupated. A moment later, life suddenly returned to the pupated caterpillars. Due
to her now thinning skin, a closer look could be seen as legs and wings that
seemed to move faster and faster. Six legs and two wings in each doll.

Suddenly, the time had come. Hundreds of butterflies flew up. One more beautiful
than the other. They shimmered in the brightest colors.

"Kamina," said Neptunia, the second, when they finally arrived back at the great
castle gate. "You saved our city. How can we ever thank You for this heroic
deed?"

"May I come back sometime?" asked Kamina.

"You are always as welcome as my own children," replied the Queen with her
flowing white hair.

Kamina looked at Neria and they blinked at each other. As she slowly strolled
back to the beach with Flox after an exuberant farewell to the royal family, she
was startled once again. She saw her brother splashing in the water in the
distance. When she looked more closely, she noticed that he wasn't splashing
around at all.

He got his foot stuck in something. He must have gotten caught in a fishing net.
Had the grabbers forgotten? Kamina could feel his fear. She quickly summoned
some of the water spirits. They had already been busy smoothing the seaweed on
which the mountain of garbage had stood.

Compared to her brother, Kamina and the water spirits were tiny. The boy kicked
desperately. But instead of loosening, his shackles only tightened tighter and
tighter. The water spirits set to work to loosen the fishing net with a few
sharp shell shards. They had to be careful not to injure Kamina's brother Yoko's
skin.

Eventually, they managed to free him and he was finally able to swim normally
again. When he looked around and looked into his sister's eyes, he shook his
head in disbelief.

To him, it was just like a fleeting moment when something tickled his foot. But
he had seen something. Was that really Kamina? Why was it so small? And were
there colorful figures next to her in the water? He must have been wrong. There
was no way that could be.

He had gotten caught in something while romping in the water and got a fright.
He blamed it on his brief confusion, turned his head away, and swam on.

"The climb to the campsite is exhausting," said Flox, who was now standing next
to her on the beach again, shaking out his mane. "But not if you're as tall as a
human."

"Yes, that's right," Kamina answered. "Can you make me grow up again?"

It didn't take a minute for Kamina to grow to her usual size.

"You must have thought you'd been gone all day, didn't you?" the unicorn asked.
"But there's one thing you need to know: When you're small, time passes more
slowly. In reality, only half an hour has passed since I downsized you."

Completely exhausted, but overjoyed, Kamina strolled back to the campsite, which
didn't seem so long to her now.

"Well, where are you from?" she greeted her mother. "We'll have lunch in a few
minutes, you're all wet and dirty. Let's jump in the shower first, honey."

When Kamina and her mother came back from the shower house, the food was already
on the table. Her father had cooked a delicious stew.

In the meantime, Yoko had also returned from the beach. Kamina glanced over at
her brother for a moment and winked at him. Yoko was a little confused, but he
understood what she was trying to say and nodded back at her with a grin.
