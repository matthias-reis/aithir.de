Ork and Elf. Whenever Sandfuss sees the two together, two thoughts run through
his head. Wo has given them their name? They should definitely switch them. And
his seond thought was: How can cats be as useless as dogs?

These two are the best example. Simple minded, always distracted by something.
And the worst thing is that he can’t share his theories with them. Over all
those years he could not find an appropriate co-investigator.

Needless to say that while he was thinking that he himself got distracted,
mainly by the scent of his Valerian. But some awkward seconds later, he stood up
and told his deputies “Let’s go!”. Of course he had forgotten to pay and Ork had
to take over as usual.

Also he didn’t have to go too far. The new client already sat on a table next to
the counter. It was a Squirrel.

Sandfuss was not really compatible with Squirrels. They were fast thinkers, but
forgot a lot. He could hardly catch up with what they said and after that he had
to ask so many questions to get the whole picture. But case is case, he thought,
and sat down on the bench.

“Hello Sir”, he started. “I’m Sandfuss, Personal Investigator.”

“Nice to meet you, I’m Acorn Nutz”, answered the Squirrel in a high pitched
voice on double speed.

Why did Ork pay the bill, you might ask, when they stayed in the bar anyway?
Well that’s easy to answer. From now on the client payed. Just in that moment,
the waitress came with a fresh Valerian cocktail.
