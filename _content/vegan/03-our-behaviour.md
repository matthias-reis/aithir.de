The previous article points out the inevitable. We will develop into a vegan
world. It's not an option to choose from in the future. It's the opposite. It
will be a very expensive option to eat meat, eggs or dairy products from time to
time. And as it has no additional value, people will just stop doing it.

While many of us are still in denial, we are already transitioning into that way
of life. Farmer see more and problems with livestock farming. Feed gets more
expensive and subsidies from the states will become less and less. On the other
hand, vegan products become more and more versatile, are healthier. People
notice that spices are vegan and therefore vegan food does not taste like
nothing. Also the rituals built around meat - barbecues, sunday roast and full
monty breakfast will have worthy replacements even without french cream sauce,
cheese finishers or omelette.

It is happening, we know that. And now it's time to dive into the why.
