After entering the shed, Lucy stood on the same grass plain. But here, she saw a
different sky, that looked much more real than the usual Mesh projections.
Somewhere in the distance, she saw the majestic tree rising in the middle of the
green sea of grass.

She started walking and with every step, she saw more details and the tree grew
bigger and bigger. Twigs were dynamically moving on the top of the crown and the
leaves seemed to change colour from time to time creating a magical shimmer
effect.

When she entered the shadowed space below the tree, still many steps away from
the trunk, she stopped for a moment and listened to the sound of the wind
blowing through the leaves.

"How can someone create such a beautiful piece of art?", she thought. It was the
most perfect Mesh diorama, she had ever seen.

Then she went on to the trunk that was as wide as a house and began to climb the
tree of life.
