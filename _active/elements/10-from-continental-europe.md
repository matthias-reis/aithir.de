The Comms, the scientists in the communication control center, knew that there
were still active satellites. The problem only was that they didn't have
contact. To be fair there was generally not much communication happening anymore
to justify their name. Except a once in a month call with some Germans.

But now, they had visitors. The dean, the theologist and Juliette and Ruth
O'Clare stood behind them at the desks with the wall of monitors. All off. Only
a small screen in the middle was turned on. The visitors had come up with the
ideas to get satellite footage.

"Let me try", said old Ruth and pushed one of the nerds out of his chair before
he even knew what happened.

She opened a terminal, typed some commands and mumbled some magic spells or
curses along the way. "WTF" was among the abbreviations she used.

A cracking came out of one of the speakers. And then a voice. "Dublin?", it said
from remote, "What did you do? We have a signal from a satellite."
