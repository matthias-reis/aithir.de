Marie approached Zodiac Station inside the most comfortable space vessel
possible. The station circled Titan, which circled Saturn, which in turn circled
our Sun, she thought sitting among 50 other suits. Representatives of wealthy
corporations of the solar system. This was the most exclusive funding event she
ever attended. And before she could finish her thought, the station appeared on
Titan's Horizon.

It was huge and symmetrical. On both sides, you could see the half-finished
ships. Their characteristic star form with five arms coming from the Dublin
drive could already be seen. And the twins were already bigger than the shuttle
they were in.

On additional parallel platforms, the manufactories were assembled, which would
be put into the belly of the drone ships when the mission started. These engines
could produce arbitrary tools, probes, miners or other devices to explore the
target solar system. They were little wharves themselves.
