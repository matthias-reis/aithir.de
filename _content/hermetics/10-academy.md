Science is a process of understanding the world. The Hermetics had started to
form networks millennia before for example, the people in Europe had settled.
And studying their own capabilities, studying magic and handing over knowledge
represented an early core aspect of such communities.

In the year 6021 BC, the Hermetic Society founded the Academy (or with its full
name the Academic Council). Other than common universities, It is an independent
organisation with subsidiaries on all continents. The Academy works based on a
sophisticated knowledge exchange system, that had worked ages before the first
telecommunication devices were invented.

Among others, the Academy includes the following faculties:

- **Hermetics**: The physical and philosophical aspects of magic
- **Hermetic Anthropology**: researching and categorising the phenomenon of
  magicians
- **History**: Analysing the detailed chronicles of Hermetics and their effects
  on humans
