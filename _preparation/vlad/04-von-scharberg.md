We, me and Maxim, were diving deeply into the archive material of that time. We
had to research five years of primary and secondary sources. I myself had
analysed the higher level sources already in Kronstadt. Here in Schäßburg there
was one name that dominated all reports, Egmond Bedeus von Scharberg.

He was an archivist here in the Registry for over two decades in the mid 15th
century and seemed to have eye witnessed the case and reported all of the files.
The first fact I found unusual was that he was also was responsible for some
secondary material, not at all according to the Registry's standards.
Conclusions had to be made by an independent other person.

The first part of our research therefore concentrated on the messenger himself.
Egmont was a dominant guy. He seemed to have only one assistant at that time and
in his conclusions, he always was very reluctant. That might be the reason why
the incidents lasted so long. He must have been involved himself.
