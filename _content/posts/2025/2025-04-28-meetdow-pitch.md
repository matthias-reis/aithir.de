Federated social networks are a huge topic in the current volatile geopolitical
and technological situation. Owning your own data, avoiding to be the product,
avoiding to lose access to years of posting history. Oligarch owned networks
that don’t want to or are not allowed to operate on your behalf anymore. All
that is in the discussion at the moment and caused an advent of (or better a
return to) decentralised approaches towards exchange.

The movement is relatively young and we seem to be in the phase where everyone
is still on eye level with all the others. But one aspect is still missing. The
connection between the real world and the social network. We all want to meet
likeminded people from time to time - and sometimes also in the physical world.
Currently there are commercial offers that provide a very low level connection
between the two worlds. You may be able to add your insta handle to a meetup
group and that’s it.

Also the available offers are commercial businesses, which is somehow
contradicting to the “open source” mood that would make many of those
communities thrive.

**So we need to bridge the gap. Let’s do it!**

# Pitch

In short the idea is to build a free and open source meetup
([https://www.meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com)) clone. A platform that allows
managing a community, planning meetings and fostering exchange in synchronous
and asynchronous ways.

## Part of the Fediverse

The solution should embrace existing protocols like Activity Pub (Mastodon) or
AT (Bluesky). It should re-use existing tooling and infrastructure as good as
possible and extend them only if needed. This allows building on a strong
technical foundation backed by many great engineers. We also leverage the
greater community that contributes to those services.

Posting announcements to the Fediverse on behalf of a community or on behalf of
an event should be easy and baked into our solution, displaying the stream of
the official hashtag of an event as well.

## Self-hosted

The to be created product should be part of a decentralised network of community
management instances. It should be modular and self-hostable.

One goal is to provide easy to use dev-ops recipes for setting up and updating
an own instance of the ecosystem. Another goal is to provide artefacts that
collect information from all the decentral systems to make them discoverable
again (e.g. though a comprehensive location based search).

## Collaborative

The functionality will extend pure event management features with extensive
asynchronous communication and exchange. Talking to speakers, aligning with
location owners, providing slides and additional material would all work without
leaving the platform (e.g. by creating Discords or Signal Groups).

## Free and Indie

![Freen to use and Open Source](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-open-l.jpg)

We want to build open source software free to use by everybody who wants to form
a community or support others in doing so. We don’t want to and most likely
won’t earn money with that ides. We won’t get rich, but we will help people find
each other.

Hosting costs money, but a decentral approach might put this onto many shoulders
backed by donations and sponsorship rather than equity. Especially all
contributors would donate their time and expertise.

## UX as First Class Citizen

![User Experience and excellent Design](/img/posts/2025/meetdown-ux-l.jpg)

A collaboration tool should be easy to use - not only by tech savvy people.
Especially if several aspects and modules from different sources are combined,
the UX and a well crafted design language are key and can even replace some
marketing move.

# First Thoughts

Not even the name is set in stone as of now. This is just a pitch or a first
vision, the napkin sketch before you buy a canvas for an oil painting. But
ideas, associations and potential leads are flying in with every minute of
research. So here’s a list of some first possibilities:

- Not one monolithic system, but at least two building blocks. An entrance
  (”Discover”) and an area behind closed doors for members (”Organise”)
- Hosting the first servers in Europe and avoiding dependencies to proprietary
  infrastructure like AWS or Vercel
- Making the Hamburg Dev User groups (HH JS, React HH, Ruby HH) potential
  contributors and then also the first users.
- Easy to add permission plugins that could leverage payments at a later stage.
  Some events just can’t be provided for free.
- Leverage existing chat ecosystems like Matrix
  ([https://matrix.org/](https://matrix.org/))
- Align on dates and calendar clashes by providing a solution like doodle
  ([https://doodle.com/](https://doodle.com/))

# What we search for

We want to build a platform for communities, but we also would like to approach
this as a community. Therefore we need contributors who’d like to donate some
free time:

- Designers, UX experts and product people who are willing to create something
  sustainable and inclusive
- Passionate frontend devs and architects who can align on a streamlined set of
  technology and frameworks
- Backend and DevOps experts willing to work on services that are integrated
  into a bigger social media landscape

Let’s return the power of community into the hands of the people. Join us today
and help shape the future of community connection and growth.
