There had to be a neutral force in the known universe. After the discovery of
the Kret and the founding of the Hyperion headquarters, there was too much going
on. Earth still had states, Kret had their family clans and the corporations
were lowering their real power only voluntarily for even more profit. And then
there were the bureaucrats on hyperion.

So it was clear that the new universal constitution would have to contain a
neutral force based on the caste of judges on Kret, but with a twist: law
enforcement and investigation. Based on the Kano of Kret, they called this
division Canon and later on invented a nice acronym to fit to their needs. After
that the term “canonical” was an established synonym for “permitted”.

The law enforcement branch of the Canon was largely controlled by a council of
terrestrial government ambassadors, representatives from the ten biggest
corporations and dedicated Kane from Kret. There was one exception. Five small
units, the SPINs were completely autonomous and only controlled each other. They
worked on the really big tasks like corruption, organised crime, smugglers and
economic cartels.
