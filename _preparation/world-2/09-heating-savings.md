I was already diving into the huge black hole of the heating sector and its
problems to go climate neutral. In fact, it's not solvable by only exchanging
technologies. We have to save energy.

Saving energy in heating does not mean, we have to live in the cold from now on
and everyone whose livingroom has more than 19 degrees is a climate change
denier. No. Savings can come from better insulations.

At the moment, the range is wide. While a typical old building needs 250
kWh/m²a, a passive house usually uses a tenth of it (less than 25 kWh/m²a).
Regulations of 1995 still allowed around 200.

But insulation measures have a problem. The physics is pretty fragile. If you
insulate only one part (e.g. better windows) or if you do it wrong (e.g.
insulate on the inside of the wall), mould is coming. So DIY is ruled out and a
heavy investment is needed.

There is an obligation to renovate in Germany and these laws are likely to be
tightened in the future. But the sector will remain the slowest.
