The safe was a different beast. It couldn't be cracked with programming skills.
That was the task of `B055`, the Operator. Hugo. did not only know most of the
security systems by heart, he also had an intuition for the situation and he had
a bespoke toolkit from `R00t`. So he went to work.

There was a scanner that searched the whole vault for intrusive objects, but it
took minutes to complete, so they had a window.

First five levels of crypto security. That was the easy part. He established a
bypass connection to one of the quantum computing arrays and within seconds,
these front doors were unlocked.

But there was more. For two virtu-physical locks, he could use a tool similar to
an endoscope for virtual rooms. He looked directly into the mechanics.

Finally the detector traps. Even being a fly didn't help. They had to find the
source and replace it. It took awfully long. The scanner would soon detect them.
Hugo's clock showed 30 seconds when they opened the door to the inner chamber.
