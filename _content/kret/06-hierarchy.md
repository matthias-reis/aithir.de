There is a strong hierarchy of social status within the arras, the Kret
families. But the system is not static. Families can rise and fall in their
reputation.

Additionally, it's getting more formal on the top, because there has to be a
committee that organizes and monitors global streams and development.

On Kret, there are nine high families, the so-called "**Arram Sul**", who
discuss and tackle these global issues. Each of the nine again has nine allied
families called "**Arram Mas**".

Each Arram Sul appoints four ambassadors, the "**Kala**". Together with the
matriarchs and the patriarchs of the high families, they form a council of 54
representatives called "**Kalam Mas**". This council could be seen as the world
government. It has an appointed moderator but there is no single leader.

Up next, you can find out more about the law and the rulebooks that constitute
life on planet Kret.
