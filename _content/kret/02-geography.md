The planet #Kret is slightly smaller than Earth. Also, gravity is lower. That's
why the Kret themselves are on average a bit taller than humans.

The surface of the planet consists of 75% ocean. The 25% rest form a single,
contiguous continent. The Kret all live along the west coast west of a large,
long mountain chain. There are only a bunch of settlements on the other side of
the continent.

The mountain range is the source of many big rivers, that flow into the sea
after going through five vast deltas. Most of the 200 million inhabitants live
in that region in smaller settlements till up to larger city-esque areas.

All rivers are connected through artificial channels with each other and form a
widespread system of transport ways that made the Kret society prosper.

Where does this lead to? More to come ...
