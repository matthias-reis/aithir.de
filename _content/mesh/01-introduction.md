I'm a developer and computer guy, so it's only natural that the most fascinating
genre in science fiction for me is Cyberpunk. My favorite novel - hereby
recommended - is Neal Stephenson's "Snow Crash".

The coolest part in this type of story always was the 3D version of the internet
in there - like the "metaverse" but much cooler, darker and also filthier. Just
like the real internet was before it was dominated by 5 mega sites.

We're still not there - nothing is 3D. Nobody (including Zuck) has even shown
off a realistic concept. We might be right ahead of a big shift in that
direction. I'm waiting for those apple glasses. But for now, it's still
imagination.

My imagined version of it (starting after I had read Snow Crash and Neuromancer
in 1992) is called "**The Mesh**" and in some posts in the next weeks, I show
off some of its details.
