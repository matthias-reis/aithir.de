There was a giant party in the Procyon colony when the ships were inaugurated.
Both cities, Loton and Racoon, have built redundant generation ships to
perfectly safeguard their passage to Luyten's star, a tiny but promising system
that is only one lightyear away. A 12 years journey.

Now the detailed plans for the selection process started, just a year ahead of
the departure. 10.000 adolescents between 16 and 20 were selected as passengers
along with 2.000 experts responsible for ship, supplies, education and
coordination.

The special training program for the chosen youngsters began the day after the
inauguration. Those were the people that were supposed to form a new society
from scratch. So they had to be prepared. Everyone got an individual trainer
assigned. They went through terraforming strategies, behavioural training,
exercises to adapt to different gravity and flight tests.

After a year, they were ready to embark.
