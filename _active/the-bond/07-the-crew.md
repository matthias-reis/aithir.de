Martin, the chief diplomat in the crew of the Rana Mission, stood in line with
the others as Captain Persson gave her speech. It was the departure speech.
Martin was a little nervous and proud. He would most likely be the Armstrong of
his era, the person who was supposed to make first contact with an alien.

But there was still a lot to achieve until this moment, so he calmed down again.
Only an hour later, the Captain gave the order for departure and the engines
ignited. Another five minutes later, they passed into transspace. The 30-ly
journey would take them one year.

During the next months, Martin's crew and the other departments had a tight
schedule. Physicists analysed the available data from the probes. The diplomats
and negotiators went through all their strategies and worked together with the
Sociologists on studies about settlements and possible social structures that
could give them hints about the character of "their" aliens. For now, they
called them "the Ranaans".
