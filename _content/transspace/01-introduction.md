If you don't want to wait years and generations until you reach another star
system, your science fiction stories have to imagine a propulsion system that
allows space travel that is faster than light.

I also needed that, so I've created one a long time ago in one of my back
stories that I'd like to present to you in yet another series of posts. I called
it the nine-dimensional **Transspace**. And bear with me, the idea is as old as
my alien race - well, somehow the humans had to meet the
[Kret](/storylines/kret), right?

So no space opera without a faster-than-light drive. My idea was not to bend
space or fly through a portal. I've just extended the known spacetime with some
useful additional dimensions (just like the real physics did extensively for a
while). Mainly I thought if the space is bending, where does it bend into. So
there had to be more than the observable dimensions.

That was my starting point ...
