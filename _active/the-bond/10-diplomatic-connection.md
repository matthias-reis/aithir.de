For Martin, the first contact was a life-changing moment, but the weeks, months
and years after that were the most work-intensive. He became the first
ambassador representing Earth as a whole while over there on his old home planet
they still thought in dimensions of states and corporations.

In the beginning, he organised a team that took care of the contacts, the
announcements and the events on the planet and he quickly became the face of
humanity for the Kret people. Later, the team became an office as more
terrestrial ships arrived and later Kret and Humans together created a beautiful
building for the representation of earth in the Rana star system.

The whole administration consisted of 50% humans and 50% Kret. There were
permanent representatives of all major Kret clans involved, but also many
helpers, craftsmen and counselors.

Martin was famous on two planets and he was very proud of that. But he also
stayed humble throughout the years just as every diplomat should.
