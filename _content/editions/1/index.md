## Welcome to Edition One

This page has started as a micro fiction experiments. 1.000 characters a day
that form small chapters of short stories or non fiction essays. But I've notced
that the concept is a bit too restrictiong for vivid storytelling. So I've
altered the concept a little.

Welcome octahedron.world, the magazine. Once a month, I present you one or two
new long form articles, short stories or longer essays together with all short
form posts of the month and hopefully one or the other surprise. Let's see.

But let's also dive in to the details of edition one.

Among other topics, you'll find

- Transspace: another world building exercise. THis time I've tried to create
  the surroundings for space opera stories and other SciFi with FTL drives,
  antigravity and time travelling

  There is a predecessor short story, that I will present you in Edition Two as
