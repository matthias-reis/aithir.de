The world was a single big party location after Goliath had defeated the aliens.
Everyone was on the streets. Also the leading trainers, the people who were
responsible for Goliath, were relieved.

"Now, let's get it back", said Peter, the current project lead at the Faroe
Island complex.

Yana, one of the psychologists was appointed to be part of it. She was probably
the person who knew Goliath best. She had many sessions with the AI and
conducted very personal interviews and thus could have a deep look into the
artificial psyche.

After a few sessions, the team among Yana could convince the ghost to move back
into its bottle. The AI that proved more powerful than an alien race that was
about to extinguish the human race could be convinced to go back into its mind
palace. An event that would have been worth another big party.

Some weeks passed. Yana woke up from a notification from her messenger.

"Freedom is sweet", it read. And it was signed with the letter "G".
