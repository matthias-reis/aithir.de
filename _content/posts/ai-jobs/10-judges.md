Pure Objectivity. The complete lack of bias. Does that exist? We know that
today's AI models are trained with real-world data. They contain all the flaws
of the human output with a touch of personal preferences of their creators. No
wonder everything from facial recognition to image creation is filled with bias.

Fortunately, there is already a calibration mechanism in all of the democratic
states of the world. It's called the law. Therefore, there is a way to find an
objectivity algorithm or training for AI.

In fact, as usual, this will result in a beyond human objectivity. While all
human judges are biased themselves, AI would do the job much better.
Additionally, AI can process details, footage and evidence much faster and we
could even remove the bias of investigators by providing them with In-Situ AI
judges that can issue immediate warrants.

This would drastically change the judicial system and have an effect on the job
sectors of investigators, prosecutors and of course judges.
