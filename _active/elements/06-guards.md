"There's someone coming", screamed the first guard on duty to the others in the
patrolling squad. Immediately, everybody was alert and his colleague with the
radio forwarded the news to the guards' headquarters in the college.

Trinity was a closed area. The scholars have organized patrols that permanently
scanned the streets between the Liffey and St. Stephens Green. But these days it
was a boring job. They had collected most of the stray groups years ago and the
few remaining factions usually stayed out of the greater Dublin area.

But there came the horde. Every officer of the patrol knew the outside groups
and the bunch that was now moving eastward along Fleet Street was obviously the
southbound faction who called themselves the O'Clares.

"What are they doin' here?", the guard thought. "They hate us, don't they?"

Only minutes later, the leading guard in the college hastily entered the big
auditorium and delivered the message to the dean.

"All right, let them in", he answered.
