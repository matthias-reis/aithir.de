Magic exists and it is well researched, but is kept a secret by the "Hermetic
Society". Please also don't ever call them magicians. They are Hermetics. **The
Hermetics**.

In a nutshell, there are astral or immaterial representations of creatures and
objects. In fact, any piece of matter in the universe possesses a more or less
strong astral core. If you divide an object (e.g. a liquid) into two parts, the
astral body also gets divided.

The astral force behind that is called "**Mana**" and it is spread very
randomly, but also very unevenly throughout all the matter of the universe.

The only major rule seems to be that life attracts more Mana than dead matter.
On top of that, the mind connected to a living being can handle Mana generally
better than water or rock.
