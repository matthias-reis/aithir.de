The expedition crew sat in the small tech room with the running computer along
with three of their hosts from Hamburg. The satellite move was almost done. In
the meantime, Ruth could have a look at some of the other systems in that room
and connect a large monitor. Cinema time.

There was even a light mood in the air, a vague memory from the time before the
incidents. Then Ruth moved the satellite footage to the big screen. It was
unsharp, so she sent some commands. After a while, the camera focused and you
could see the view of greater London.

Well, not entirely. The whole western area, Hammersmith, Shepherd's Bush,
Fulham, Kensington and half of Hyde Park formed a huge lake fed by the Thames.
That's where the bomb had been detonated. Everyone fell silent.

"Do you see that shadow in the centre of the lake?", said the Theologist
finally. "Can you zoom in?"

Ruth adjusted the footage and there they were. Thousands of undefined creatures
stream out of a void like ants.
