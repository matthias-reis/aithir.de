People usually don't believe that our current food consumption is a major player
in the climate crisis. I have to say that the connections are very complicated.
They're going from Methane in the digestion cycle of cows through transport to
rainforest clearing in Brazil. I'd like to get a grip on that myself. That's why
I'd like to dedicate part two of my posting series to this topic.

On top of that, the climate is only one of many plagues meat consumption causes.
It's the main driver of the decline in biodiversity. It causes serious health
issues driven by lies triggered by a cruel meat and milk lobby. and by the way,
it's completely unethical.

I myself chose to be a vegan eight or nine years ago and I've learned a lot
about the other topics along the way. The possibilities for a vegan diet have
increased ever since. The topic is booming. I'm sure it's not a trend that will
go away anytime soon.
