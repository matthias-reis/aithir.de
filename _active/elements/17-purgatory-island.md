A quarter of an hour later, they were flying over the crater lake. Water was
everywhere, but here and there some of the ruins of large, flooded buildings
stood out of the water's surface. And then also these could not be seen anymore.
The crater lake was deepening towards the centre.

What Ruth also saw on the monitor was a current. Water was flowing towards the
centre of the lake. That's where the vortex was.

"There", the Theologist shouted, pointing his hand towards the front windscreen
of the plane. What was that? An object or several ones. Land. Now Ruth was sure
it was a landmass. There were islands in the middle of the crater. They must
have been placed right in front of the vortex.

Ruth quickly pointed the outside camera to this place to get clearer footage and
followed its focus as they moved along.

"Purgatory Island", coined the Theologist its name. "The last stop before hell.
That must be the place where the demons are stranding."
