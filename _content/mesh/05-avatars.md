After the first exercises, where test users had been given the ability to design
their own characters, it turned out that people tended to experiment. Some of
them created unproportionally huge or much too small avatars.

After that, the designers of the mesh added restrictions. An Avatar, which is
the representation of a user in the Mesh must be between 1 u and 2 u in height
and a maximum of 1 u in width and depth.

Up to today, these are the only restrictions. If you walk along the streets of
the more crowded areas, you see many different characters ranging from
photorealistic to exotically fluffy. Most people even have several avatars they
can choose from when entering the Mesh. One of the photorealistic types is
usually always in the portfolio.

Clothing is a big topic as well and because you can already express a lot of
individuality with it, the realistic avatar is being picked 19 out of 20 times.
