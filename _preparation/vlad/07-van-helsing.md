Twice. We investigated twice in the wrong direction, first Vlad and then this
Westenra lady. This is not me. Usually, I don't make these kinds of mistakes. I
seemed to be biased. So the next steps had to be done with more clarity. We
looked at the prosecutor. Abraham van Helsing.

That part in Stokers' book sounded absurd and unrealistic, but we stumbled upon
the name in one of von Scharbergs notes. This man existed. So we tracked him
down. He was registered in the Amsterdam registry at level eight. What a
surprise, a worthy arch-nemesis for Vlad. So no wonder that someone made a book
out of it.

He was an executive for the hermetic court in Vienna at that time. So after the
first rumours, the authorities assigned him to the case. We've found the
assignment letter in the files. His task was apparently not only to catch Vlad
and drag him to court. No. His task was to end this episode, to crush the
vampire cult in the making.
