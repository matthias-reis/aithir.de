We know that electric cars are better in many ways. Among others, they are three
times more efficient than combustion engines. But their batteries are a huge
burden. We have to use them more efficiently.

As cars are also standing around 95% of their time and using up valuable space
in cities, this might be a good opportunity to tackle both problems.

The good news is that the most obvious solution already exists: **Car sharing**.
Having a pool of co-owned cars means that they are used more frequently. Their
batteries - bad in production and effective during operation - work much more
effectively and longer in the post-break-even phase. And parking lots are
emptier, streets are not bordered with metal blobs.

On top of that the maintenance of the cars can be handled professionally. And
the latest and most efficient technology can be deploed in higher frequencies.

People just have to get used to the fact that they don't own their car anymore.
One status symbol less.
