Some years ago, my wife [Anne](https://cardamonchai.com) and I have managed to
write a full novel. We're very proud of it. I still love the story after
re-reading it some seasons later.

The writing is in German, but we thought of having it revised and professionally
translated.

It's a fantasy story and it all started with some ideas on how to transfer the
"magicians" trope from the hyped "Harry Potter" into a topic for adult readers.
Also, I found many of the decisions around world-building in Rowling's stories
pretty weak. Additionally, I always wanted to do something with the "Secret
Society" trope like Illuminati or the Free Masons. So we combined these two
topics.

We came up with a backstory, a concept of how such a world would work first.
Over time, we added more and more details about the story before we even started
writing concrete chapters.

Throughout the next weeks, I can give you some details from that conceptional
phase and the possibilities that appeared along the way.
