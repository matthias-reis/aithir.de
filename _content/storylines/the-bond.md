## Marla

Marla had been a gifted child. She graduated at age 13, got her master's degree
at 15 and wrote an already groundbreaking piece as her PhD Thesis when she
was 20. That was in the year 2089.

But that was not the end. She was not obsessed with going deeper into one field.
She wanted to go broader. She wanted to have an explanation for the universe as
a whole. And she was very good at some really helpful things along the way.
Thinking outside the box like her role model Albert Einstein. Working with AI in
terms of training and giving them the right kind of work at the right time. It
was some kind of symbiosis. But she also had a good portion of realism and an
understanding of economy and psychology.

At age 26, in 2095, she published her groundbreaking paper "A Theory of
Transspace". A paper that was supposed to change the world more radically than
the Theory of Relativity or Darwin's Origin of Species.

But also that was just the start.

---

Later on, Marla became more famous than Einstein, but not only because of her
groundbreaking papers that changed physics. After that, she organized the think
tank "Enclave" and gathered the most brilliant minds for years to deepen her
theories.

Yet another step increased her fame and that is the fact that she made money out
of her discoveries. So much that she became the third richest person in the
solar system with her megacorp Zodiac.

At that time there were already four other global players, who were not so
global anymore. They made their money by mining asteroids, running space station
chains and interplanetary transport. All of them were eager to use the new tech.
But Marla and Zodiac owned many of the patents and had the talent and skills.

Even the name was wisely chosen as two of the other corporations were called
Sagittarius and Scorpio. Zodiac for them might have sounded like a declaration
of war, but at the same time, they needed access to that groundbreaking
technology.

---

Fifty years later, the solar system was split between huge corporations with
more financial power than any state on earth. The Dublin drive, invented by
Zodiac, was the dominant spaceship technology. So the company became number two,
so huge that it could buy number three, Sagittarius. But the possibilities to
grow didn't end there.

After Marla Lay, Chi Feng became chairman. He came up with the idea to put his
claim on other star systems. He was a diplomat and cultivated good relations
with the other Megacorps and managed to form a consortium with five of his
competitors. Their project: sending discovery drones into the universe.

Already two years later, the first pair of drones launched from the facilities
at Zodiac station. Project Gemini started to Alpha Centauri and Barnard's Star.
The drones were built to find habitable planets and valuable asteroids and acted
as communication phalanxes for the probes they carried in their bodies.

---

## Marie

Marie approached Zodiac Station inside the most comfortable space vessel
possible. The station circled Titan, which circled Saturn, which in turn circled
our Sun, she thought sitting among 50 other suits. Representatives of wealthy
corporations of the solar system. This was the most exclusive funding event she
ever attended. And before she could finish her thought, the station appeared on
Titan's Horizon.

It was huge and symmetrical. On both sides, you could see the half-finished
ships. Their characteristic star form with five arms coming from the Dublin
drive could already be seen. And the twins were already bigger than the shuttle
they were in.

On additional parallel platforms, the manufactories were assembled, which would
be put into the belly of the drone ships when the mission started. These engines
could produce arbitrary tools, probes, miners or other devices to explore the
target solar system. They were little wharves themselves.

---

The endeavour with the first twins was a fifty per cent success. Probe number
one brought amazing results from our nearest neighbour, Alpha Centauri. But the
probe to Barnards Star had a series of failures in its transmission module and
didn't deliver results.

Marie, in the meantime CFO of the company she had invested for, anyway reached
her goal. For her, it was the start of an exclusive holiday and migration
business. Time to build hotels on Proxima Centauri 3.

The Twins project and Marie's investments were not finished. Every six months,
Zodiac was ready with another pair of probes and sent them on their way to the
stars in our neighbourhood. Twenty destinations within five years and almost
each of them with financial success. Some companies profited from mining, others
started terraforming and creating settlements. Dozens of groups of people wanted
to start a new way of living.

In the sixth year, however, one of the probes reported the discovery of
intelligent life.

## Martin

During the 22 missions before one of the probes targeted the Rana Starsystem,
the Gemini project already had found two planets with lifeforms. One infected
with funghi and another one with an almost breathable atmosphere and grass-like
plants.

But Rana was different. The Star system is about 30 Lightyears away and already
the first spectroscopic studies showed life signs and activity. The Gemini
headquarters immediately sent orders for visual observation, so the probe sent
out a bunch of drones with hi-res optics. There were settlements and humanoid
lifeforms dwelling on that planet.

So the next step was clear. A mission was planned. The wharves around titan and
in the Jupiter orbit were routined. Within one year they conceived and built a
ship for a 100 people crew. Staff selection and training started and strategies
were formed by the brightest minds that could be found on earth.

The crew consisted of sociologists, linguists, biologists, engineers and a
handful of reporters.

---

Martin, the chief diplomat in the crew of the Rana Mission, stood in line with
the others as Captain Persson gave her speech. It was the departure speech.
Martin was a little nervous and proud. He would most likely be the Armstrong of
his era, the person who was supposed to make first contact with an alien.

But there was still a lot to achieve until this moment, so he calmed down again.
Only an hour later, the Captain gave the order for departure and the engines
ignited. Another five minutes later, they passed into transspace. The 30-ly
journey would take them one year.

During the next months, Martin's crew and the other departments had a tight
schedule. Physicists analysed the available data from the probes. The diplomats
and negotiators went through all their strategies and worked together with the
Sociologists on studies about settlements and possible social structures that
could give them hints about the character of "their" aliens. For now, they
called them "the Ranaans".

---

Arriving in the Rana system was less spectacular than Martin thought. The
blackness of the space there followed the blackness between the systems. The
only difference was a star that shone a bit brighter than usual. They still had
two days until they were supposed to reach the orbit.

Martin also knew that it was not planned to meet the aliens directly after their
arrival. The plan was a detailed half-year observation mission before first
contact. But it was a change for good for the surprisingly impatient diplomat.

He was not the mission lead, but in the council and so he had enough to do,
enough to think. They reached the orbit of Rana 3 and Martin's mood immediately
changed. Actually, everyone on the ship turned from impatient waiting mode to
planned activity. Probes were prepared. Camouflage surveillance drones were sent
to the ground. Translator systems were set up. Teams started to make theories.
And Martin absorbed the information for his first contact strategy.

---

The following weeks brought inflation of knowledge. The probes on the surface of
Rana 3 worked perfectly. The translator AI learned the new languages within a
week. In the same week, the crew gathered geographical and sociological data.
After that, the working teams augmented their observations with statements from
the aliens.

They learned that they called themselves the Kret. Martin was concentrated.
Within three weeks, he and his team had to learn about the Krets' history,
preferences and habits. Those were the remaining bits that went into the grand
plan to get in contact.

All the rest was already worked out on Earth and during the long trip. Which
landing place they would choose, which people they would pick, all of that was
well known. But the things that mattered most, what he would say, was Martins's
decision alone. A truly giant leap for mankind, but also himself.

Now, a team of seven was sitting in a shuttle waiting to be transported to the
first contact.

---

For Martin, the first contact was a life-changing moment, but the weeks, months
and years after that were the most work-intensive. He became the first
ambassador representing Earth as a whole while over there on his old home planet
they still thought in dimensions of states and corporations.

In the beginning, he organised a team that took care of the contacts, the
announcements and the events on the planet and he quickly became the face of
humanity for the Kret people. Later, the team became an office as more
terrestrial ships arrived and later Kret and Humans together created a beautiful
building for the representation of earth in the Rana star system.

The whole administration consisted of 50% humans and 50% Kret. There were
permanent representatives of all major Kret clans involved, but also many
helpers, craftsmen and counselors.

Martin was famous on two planets and he was very proud of that. But he also
stayed humble throughout the years just as every diplomat should.

---

Martin and the other leads of the first contact crew regularly spent their
evenings together with dinner and discussions since the launch of the mission.
One day, about four months after the first contact, Amanda, the chief biologist,
came out of nowhere with a topic. "These are no aliens", she said and got the
attention of everyone in the room.

The Kret were so similar to us in their phsiology, that people speculated from
the beginning. But now, Amanda said, there was proof.

"We have the results now", she continued. "we are gentically related. We don't
know every detail yet, but we are pretty sure that the split could have happened
about 100 to 200 thousand years ago."

The others had stopped eating and stared at her in a jaw-dropping way. It took
Martin a full minute to recover and ask his first question.

"What do you think happened one hundred thousand years ago?", he asked and the
speculations began.
