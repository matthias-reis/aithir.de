Our neighbor solar system was quite a hostile place. Neither planet nor any moon
was suitable for terraforming. The expeditions of the generation ship took ten
years to find an appropriate place for a settlement.

They have chosen a rocky moon circling a calm planet around Alpha Centauri A.
The moon had many connected cave systems and perfect exposition to the light of
its star. They called it Bianor and from then on they were the Bianorians.

It took five more years until the first larger group moved into their habitats
in the caves and a whole generation until everything was settled and not
provisional anymore.

Then the new colony started its Sagittarius program again, set up a local
interplanetary fleet and later started to dis- and re-assemble the huge
generation starship for the next iteration.

500 years later the colony was thriving with 50 million people. They colonized a
second planet, Cheiron.
