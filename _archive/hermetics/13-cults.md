The success story of the Hermetic Society lies in its fanatic secrecy on the one
hand and its exertion of influence and power on the other hand. However, you
can't keep a secret for 10.000 years without leaks.

There have been bigger and smaller factions and cults who wanted to run things
differently, inform the world about magic or strive for secular power. Others
had simply been cut off from the world for a while. The observers have dealt
with each of these cases.

But you can never wipe out all traces. Witnesses continued telling their
stories. Some outsiders believed them. For others, they were too fantastic. And
witness reports turned to rumours and rumours turned to legends.

Some of these legends were the spark of religion. Voodoo is only one example.
Others turned into stories that changed so much that you wouldn't recognize
their origin anymore. Think of Dracula and the vampires.
