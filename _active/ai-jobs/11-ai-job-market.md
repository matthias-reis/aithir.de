I started the posts about AI jobs in June of last year with the strong belief
that things will get disrupted in the next decades. In the meantime, the
development exploded. Ten months are three AI generations and an exponential
increase in capabilities.

I have no doubt that many jobs, not only the ten sectors that I introduced in
this series, will be affected. In most cases the jobs will simply be different.
Open AI boss Sam Altman said, if coding will get easier, we simply write much
more code. There is always a demand for more. Everywhere.

If you think you know the answer, you might be wrong. Someone on the internet
said, that you have to know how to write prompts. That would be the future.
Well, that tweet won't age well I guess, because also the interface and
comprehension of these systems will improve.

Times are both exciting and frightening. But going against this trend is only an
option when you go into the niches that are less affected (crafts, nursing care,
etc.).
