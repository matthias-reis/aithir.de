"The aliens know us" was what everybody had in their heads after the second
wave. Now, what would they do to us? Some even said that they would solve all
our problems.

But the others were right. Those who said that they would kill us.

It was obvious that there were only 61 of their ships. But each of their crews
was fast and had surgical precision. They stroke all day. They killed in streaks
and yet they could hardly be identified. There was next to no footage from them
except some blurry phone videos from people who obviously took more interest in
running away than actually filming.

After the first day, we counted 5000 dead people. But the raid continued for
another week until we could take first serious countermeasures. Around 50.000
people were already dead at that point.

"Bad news", the papers titled, when our first attempts to defend ourselves
failed and every day, we tried heavier and heavier weapons without success.
