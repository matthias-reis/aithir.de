About a month ago Peter turned eleven. It was an amazing day. He got a lot of
tech gadgets. That was his passion these days. The coolest present was from his
father, a digital pad where he could learn programming. He practices with it
ever since. He even could plug in a little Lego robot and remote control it.

Peter is very independent. Sometimes, his parents even leave him alone while
doing errands. Today was such a day. He had two hours of robot craft. But some
days ago, his father showed him something even more fascinating in the garage,
an old radio system.

The dusty device looked so different from today's technology. Probably that is
what excited him. At the moment even more than his talking DIY robot project.

He went downstairs and entered the small workshop next to the garage. There it
stood, the device, that looked like a robot itself with all its switches,
cables, and speakers. But it was turned off.

---

Peter was hesitant as he approached the radio device. It was his guilty
conscience speaking, but there also was a little devil sitting on his other
shoulder, curiosity. So he turned on the old chrome switch on the left.

The lights on the strange displays turned on and a loud white noise came out of
the speakers. Peter fell into panic. Quickly he searched for the volume knob,
finally found it and reduced the volume. Puh, that was close.

But then, after a thorough look at all the buttons and switches, he remembered
what his father showed him the other day. With the one on the right, you adjust
the wavelength - yes, that was the word - to find channels where people were
chatting.

Firstly, Peter memorized the current wavelength to be able to turn it back in
the end, 27.335. Then he started to search for channels.

On one of them, he heard someone talking, who sounded like his neighbour, Mr
White. He spoke to his baby son Josua. That was strange, so he kept listening
for a while.

---

Peter listened to their neighbour for another while. He remembered that his
father said that some baby phones were also using radio signals. But the sound
was very noisy. So he turned the knob again until he heard a loud, jarring feep
on channel 14. He panicked again a bit, but he found the knob to turn the volume
down.

"Ben? Hello? Is it you?", he received from the speaker. Ben was his father's
name so Peter became curious. What should he do? Answer? His index finger was
already lying on the button of the desk microphone.

"Heee-lloo?", came it out of the radio again. And Peter pushed the button.

"Hi", he said with a tiny, cautious voice. "It's Peter. Who are you?"

"Oh-h, hello Pe-eeee-ter." The sound was still disrupted by noise from time to
time. "My name is Asimo-ov. You are Ben's son, aren't yo-ou?"

"Yes. Do you know my father?" Without thinking too much about the consequences,
Peter started talking to that stranger. His curiosity was stronger.

---

"Oh, how lo-ovely", answered the calm and friendly voice from the speaker.
"Finally, I ge-eet to know Ben'szs son. As I said, I am Asimov. And, you won't
believfffe it, I'm a robot from the bea-uuutiful asteroid Flora".

Asimov was hard to understand. The background noises were annoying, but Peter
understood very well, although he couldn't believe what he had heard.

"Boah, really?", he asked with amazement. "A real robot? Where do you come from?
What is asteroid?"

"An as-zsss-teroid is a very small planet. I'm circling the sun just like you.
Ben told me, that you are szsuch a cuu-urious child. You know about planetszs?"

"Boah", said Peter again, "then you're not even from Earth. You are an alien
robot? How cool."

Peter got more and more excited and the chat went on for several minutes but he
also had a guilty conscience.

"I have to stop now", he finally said. "I'm not even allowed to be here. My
parents are back soon."

"All right", returned Asimov. "But I have something for you."

---

"My Sensors", said the Robot with the background noise of the radio, "they show
that you have a device with-sss you. Is that true?"

Peter had to think for a moment. This voice said it was a robot from another
planet, but it could also be a lie. But what could happen on his own pad? "Yes,
my pad", he finally said.

"Great", answered Asimov, "now have a look at your home screen. You will find a
new icon."

Peter opened the device and saw it. "Wait, what? How did you do that? What does
it do?"

"I can communicate with machines. After all, I'm one of them myself. This app is
connected to a small flying camera over here. You can see me and talk to me face
to robot face. And you can even fly around on Flora."

"Really?" answered Peter incredulously. He had to try it out immediately. He
started the app and saw video footage-blurred and wiggly at first. But after it
stabilised, there was a clear picture. He looked into friendly eyes on a display
in a robot's face.

---

"Hello again, Peter", said the Robot - this time with a crystal clear voice.
"It's me again, Asimov. Good to see you. It's always better to have a picture,
isn't it? Look around, welcome to Flora."

Peter was in the most astonished and curious mood he had ever been since this
whole adventure started. But this was the best. He looked into his pad and saw a
new world on another planet, well asteroid.

He could use the controls on the display to look around just like in a video
game. He saw green grass on the floor, bright as the day. But the sky was as
dark as the night. And there was a hut or a small house. That was surely Asimovs
home.

And look at that. Peter found the button to zoom in and could see some details.
Dozends of working machines. Robots of all sorts. Some carried things, some
digged holes, others planted flowers.

"Yor pad is now permanently connected to Flora", said Asimov in a calm voice. "I
have reserved you a drone camera. So you can travel around wherever you want."

---

Peter couldn't think of anything else than the Asteroid Flora. He sat together
with his parents at the dinner table, but he wasn't even hungry. His mother
asked a question and he didn't even notice. He couldn't wait to get back and
start the app. Luckily, his mother sent him to his room.

He unlocked the pad immediately. Now he could take a closer look at the alien
world. At first, nobody seemed to be there, so he started flying around and
discovering the surroundings.

The first astonishing thing he saw was, he zoomed in to be really sure, yes, it
was a floor lamp like the one in his granny's house. But this one moved around.
It was also a robot.

"Hello", the lamp said suddenly. "You must be Peter. Nice to meet you. I'm
Tiffany."

He got chatting with Tiffany the lamp. And while they talked, others came along
as well. There was Cuthbert the cupboard and not to forget Arne, the chair.

Peter talked with them for half an hour until his mother knocked and came in. So
he quickly had to switch off the pad and hide it under his blanket.

---

In the following days, Peter thought a lot about the robots on Flora. How did
that work? Were they alive or just toys and devices? He didn't even understand
the difference. On the next day, he met Asimov and asked him.

"Ah boy, you ask the right questions. You have a curious mind. Others take much
longer to come up with this question", said Asimov and Peter thought about who
these others were. But that was another puzzle.

"For the answer, I will show you two things. Here's number one. Look", Asimov
continued while showing Peter his left robot arm. A small plug came out with a
soft electric noise. "This is my activation interface. That's what I call it. I
can connect with everything through this and spread intelligence and mechanics.
Everything that I touch with it will become a robot like your friends Tiffany,
Cuthbert and Arne".

He took a stone with his right hand and touched it for a while with the plug in
his left hand. Then the stone transformed. First, it formed eyes.

---

Then something happened. While the stone in Asimov's hand continued transforming
into a robot and before he could show Peter his second trick, Asimov noticed
something going on in the background that alerted him. He turned around and also
Peter saw it when he zoomed out on his pad viewer. The large buildings in the
background that stood on either side of the crater rim started to move.

Asimov and his friends lived in a place that was guarded by high mountain
ranges. One day, Asimov had explained that they were inside a crater and that
things were green here but grey and brown on the outside. And there were two
large buildings besides the hut. One looked like a fortress, dark and angry. The
other one was a castle, large and white with many small crenelations and fine
architecture.

What Peter saw in his pad was that the fortress seemed to stand up. He had to
look twice. The building moved and seemed to spit small portions of fire toward
the castle. These gigantic houses were fighting.

---

"Oh dear," said Asimov. He seemed calm, prepared, and alert at the same time, as
if he had expected something like that to happen.

"Well, Peter," he continued, pointing at the fortress. "And that is the big
version of the trick. A long time ago, I turned it into a robot. But it didn't
work out that well, as you can see. From time to time, it gets angry. Sorry,
pal, I have to leave you alone to look after this situation."

Peter was stunned once again. He had learned so much about Flora and its
inhabitants in the last few weeks, but there was always a bigger surprise around
the corner. The fortress was a huge robot, but Peter was sure that the castle
was another one. He could swear that he also saw this beautiful building move
some of its towers and roofs to dodge the little fire bombs from the fortress.

He steered his drone around a little bit and flew higher for a better overview.
The castle still looked angry, but Asimov was already on his way. Peter saw him
on the road, almost there.

Now the two biggest windows of the castle, which looked like eyes, spotted
Asimov, and it immediately stopped spitting fire.

For now, the situation seemed to be calmed down, and Peter could take a deep
breath.

---

On the next day, Asimov approached Peter.

"Hello, Peter!" He waved at him as he rolled in the direction of Peter's drone.
"I think, I still owe you the second skill that I wanted to show you, remember?"

"Hi Asimov, yes, I almost forgot. So much happened yesterday. I hope everything
is alright?" "Yes, that happens sometimes. And actually what I want to show you
is directly connected to that little conflict."

"It didn't seem so little to me. But I'm curious about what you want to show
me."

"Ok, it's much harder to explain because you don't see it as clearly as the
robot trick. Well, you may already have wondered what I have in my right hand.
The activation interface that I showed you on the left could turn things into a
robot. Look here, it's Grumpy, the stone robot that we created yesterday." Peter
made a shaking move through his drone and the little bouncing robot answered
with a funny sound to greet back.

"Now here's my right arm", Asimov continued and showed Peter how another device
similar to the plug on the left came out of its hand. "I call this one the
animation interface. It can give consciousness to a robot."

"Consciousness?", asked Peter. "We've talked about this at school and later that
day in the evening I also asked Dad, but I didn't really understand it, to be
honest."

"Well, that's because it's probably the most complicated thing I know. Humans
like you have it, and some animals as well. But robots usually don't. A simple
definition would be that you know who and what you are. But that is so much
simpler than reality."

"And you can give consciousness to other robots?"

"Yes, Peter. That is what the animation interface does. Unfortunately, this
skill is very sensitive. In the past, here on Flora, we had some unpleasant
events, so I can't show it to you at the moment. But we can continue talking
tomorrow if you like. Probably in the meantime, you want to find out more about
consciousness yourself."

As usual, Asimov seemed to know what was going on in Peter's life. As he looked
at the watch on his pad, he saw that his parents would be home soon, so he
logged out for the moment. He just had some seconds to think about what he had
learned today before he heard his parents coming through the entrance door.
