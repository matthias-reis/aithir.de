There are three big worldbuilding systems that I have developed over time.
There's the Cyberpunk UNiverse from the Mesh, there are the Hermetics, my take
on magic and urban fantasy and there is Transspace, my very old idea on how you
could pass the barrier of light speed and thus enable stories that involve other
worlds.

Each of these systems spawn ideas for stories and anecdotes. And so i dedicate a
whole category to each of them. This is the one for Transspace.

I'd like to start with some backing thoughts about the idea. I have created
these concepts ages ago, in the early nineties (that is 1992 to about 1997). At
that time, I was a huge fan of Star Trek. The last episodes of the Next
generation were airing and further spin offs like DS9 were great.

But also, my general knowledge about the fabric of space were limited (they
still are today), so my approach for a GUT, a great unifying theory, that unites
quantum physics and the theory of relativity, seems rather unique and more
unrealistic these days.

On the other hand though, the storytelling possibilities it spawns are great. It
makes the technobabble tangible but complex enough to be interesting. And it
leaves loop holes for time travel and the much discussed multiverse.

So in these anecdotes I want to visit some of the historic moments as well as
everyday life space soap opera type episodes like:

- the life of Marla Lay, the inventor of the theory
- the big corporations with more money than the government that defined the
  rules of space travel
- the first contact with extraterrestrial life
- communication and entertainment in the future
- a space police crew
- more background facts about my longer stories

Let's see where this leads me.
