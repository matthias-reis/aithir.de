Last weekend, my journey has continued to cover both of my arms with tattoos.
This time: **left forearm**. It hurt quite a bit.

I always get asked what the meaning of the motives is - or what they symbolize
in my life. As if something that permanent would need to have a deeper cause.
Nope. They don't mean anything, they're just art. They acquire meaning by being
on my skin.

But as I'm into making up stories, I've also tried to find commonalities and a
meaning or a small world that opens up when you look behind the already existing
general themes. Inspired by Ray Bradbury's "The Illustrated Man".

My right arm is the fantasy side. Its story plays on a far east ocean and
involves Shinto spirits and Japanese demons.

The left side is the one being created at the moment. It combines science
fiction and nature with cyborg creatures that turn nature into tech or vice
versa.
