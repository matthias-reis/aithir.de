Just like any other piece of matter or creature, human beings can also attract
Mana. But they can make much more use of it. Already in the early days - even
before we formed civilizations, we've recognized that force.

Nowadays, the phenomenon is well researched. Every human has a more or less
large astral body. But only a small percentage have an at least significantly
measurable amount of Mana - about 1.5 to 1.7% or ~120 Mio people worldwide.
That's what the scientists call stage 1. Just like with the Richter Scale,
there's exponential growth in power built into the scale.

Hermetics get registered in a central registry, which is mandatory when you're
in stage 5 or higher. Worldwide, there are only 15.000 stage 10 Hermetics
registered in that database. The strongest living Hermetic is a man from Mexico,
registered at stage 19.
