Zizkov was a rather strange place to live these days. But Hana liked the
atmosphere, which spanned between the cosy, old and worn down artist houses and
the rotten monster of concrete, the tower that once was used for TV
transmission. She bet that no one in Prague even knew anymore what a TV was. She
also only knew it from her stubborn grandparents who refused to use the Mesh.

She was sitting in the Bar Bukowski, her living room, the nicest place on earth.
Her lenses were in AR mode so she could breathe its atmosphere while thinking
about her complicated second life as `R00t`.

`R00t`, the hacker was not complicated at all. What gave her a headache was her
relationship with two people at the same time. She loved `B055`, but she also
worked with him every day, so she couldn't tell him. But she also loved Adele,
his girlfriend. And she never met anyone of them in real life. A triangle of
tragedies. If everything could be as easy and clear as coding, she thought.
