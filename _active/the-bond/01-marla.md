Marla had been a gifted child. She graduated at age 13, got her master's degree
at 15 and wrote an already groundbreaking piece as her PhD Thesis when she
was 20. That was in the year 2089.

But that was not the end. She was not obsessed with going deeper into one field.
She wanted to go broader. She wanted to have an explanation for the universe as
a whole. And she was very good at some really helpful things along the way.
Thinking outside the box like her role model Albert Einstein. Working with AI in
terms of training and giving them the right kind of work at the right time. It
was some kind of symbiosis. But she also had a good portion of realism and an
understanding of economy and psychology.

At age 26, in 2095, she published her groundbreaking paper "A Theory of
Transspace". A paper that was supposed to change the world more radically than
the Theory of Relativity or Darwin's Origin of Species.

But also that was just the start.
