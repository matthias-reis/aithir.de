Ruth worked on the footage, zoomed in and out and started to print maps and
aerial pictures of the current situation. She managed to focus the satellite
optics properly and received high-res images from demons with horns and hoofs.

Later on, they sat together in the dining area to take decisions.

"We have friends near Boulogne", said Paul, one of the Hamburg residents. "They
maintain the harbour and a small airfield over there."

"Sounds good", responded Ruben, "we could get better footage."

"Yes", approved Ruth. "Do you think, you could contact them? I believe, we need
to get nearer to the hive."

"We can try to make contact. The last time, we spoke to them, they still
maintained two aeroplanes. I'm sure they would help us."

It took another two days to make radio contact. The planes were still active and
they could reach the London area. But there were sightings of demons on the
French coast as well.

They had to hurry. So on the next day, they set sail to Boulogne-sur-mer.
