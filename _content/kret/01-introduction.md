Aliens have always been the icing on the science fiction cake.

When I was sixteen, I started imagining extraterrestrial worlds. Partly to
understand our own world better. I called my first alien race "The Kret". The
world building went deep into details. During the next weeks, I'll continue
posting some of them.

The Kret have a lot of similarities with the humans. Reasonable explanations
will be provided for that aspect. However, their society and existence differ
drastically from ours. But let's go through the bare facts first.

My aliens live on an earth-like planet called Kret, that orbits the star Rana or
Delta Eridani within its habitable zone. Rana is about 30 Ly away from earth. My
choice for that system took me weeks at that time. Particularly it was
pre-internet and before the discovery of exoplanets. Today, we have proof of
thousands of planets in almost every star system, but not in that one.
