On a milestone date, January 1st 2100, a company formed out of the enclave think
tank launched a product they called "Grava", a brand name that would become a
synonym for force field tech afterwards.

Within two years, all excavators in the construction business had been replaced.
Other companies licensed the technology and developed highly efficient planes,
air trains and hoppers.

In a modern space hopper, you will find 16 different Grava appliances. One of
them is responsible for a constant force vector, another for acceleration and
again others for accident protection or compensation of acceleration forces.

The space travel sector with its formerly expensive and risky launches profited
the most from the new Grava-based hoppers.
