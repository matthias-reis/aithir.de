The theory of Transspace has been created by the dutch scientist **Marla Lay**.
She started to work on it during her PhD phase at the end of the 2080s and
published the groundbreaking paper in the year 2095.

The theory came with twelve base formulae and didn't contain any singularities
anymore like most of its predecessors. Yet it could be considered a superset of
the theory of relativity and the quantum theory for most aspects. But now, we
could also predict the edge cases.

Although Lay was in the lead, she already had a rather big staff and one of the
best quantum computer arrays to work with. And also later, she went through an
unorthodox path and decided to involve the best scientists and engineers in the
world to work on practical proof and potential technical inventions.

Project "**Enclave**" started in 2096. More in the next post.
