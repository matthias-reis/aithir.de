There are quite some storylines flying around on this account and I'm excited to
start another today.

Some years ago, I started a novel, a post-apocalyptic dystopia with mixed-in
religious and fantastic elements. Namely demons and devils. But not so much in
the religious way.

I called it "Elements", because it was planned as a road trip from land through
water, into the fire and back through the air. It starts with a deserted Europe
where only a few people have survived and the shores have massively changed
through bombs and nature taking back what belongs to her. And it's also a
classic symbolic fight - science against evil.

At that time I neither had the stamina for a whole novel nor was the story rich
enough. A better opportunity was supposed to come later.

But that story surely still makes a beautiful tale told in short blocks of a
thousand characters at a time. So during the next weeks, I'll dive into hell and
back again.

Hope you'll enjoy.
