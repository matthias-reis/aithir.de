Bureaucracy, just like science was an invention by the Hermetic Society. They
call their Offices the Registry. Its first task is to record history and manage
all past records. But its main duty is to collect information on all
level-four-plus hermetics in the world.

Right now, a bit over 6 million living people are registered in the huge
database, which is these days, of course fully digitised and searchable if you
have the right clearance.

Even in old times, long before the first canonical scripts had spread through
the rest of humanity, the Registry had collected data on stone boards and
aggregated them in a structured way.

Everything is ordered hierarchically and therefore centrally. On the top, the
registry is led by a board called Register's Council, the second of three
Councils that support the organisation of the Hermetic Society. From there, the
structure spreads like a fan through all continents, regions and cities.
