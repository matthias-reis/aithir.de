Superpowers in SciFi and Fantasy literature come from the wish of us humans to
achieve more than what is theoretically possible on the one hand. On the other
hand, they are a trait of being different and therefore they are often used as
an analogy to unveil prejudice and envy.

The most well-known subtype connects this trope with the hero archetype and
creates the superhero, that everyone knows. Marvel, DC and other comics are very
prominent examples. Especially in X-Men for instance, the topic of envy and
persecution is popping up even among these heroic storylines.

But superpowers have more subtle appearances in many other stories as well.
Superpowers can be seen a generalisation of concepts like magic in fantasy
tropes or genetic mutations in pulp sci-fi. The list is endless.

Wherever you look, the average person is intimidated by people with superpowers.
Therefore these people are hiding their abilities and therefore make themselves
more suspicious. And all goes down the spiral. All of that can easily be
translated into normal world problems of being afraid of foreigners and
immigrants.
