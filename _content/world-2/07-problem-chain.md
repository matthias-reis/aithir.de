In the past posts connected in this chain here, I got a short glimpse of the
three topics (Traffic, Food and Energy). But I've already seen that any of these
fields is utterly complex and never black and white. So before I go into more
details on each of them, let's go back to the basic problem.

Earth thankfully has a greenhouse effect. It would be a cold dead place of -18°C
if it wasn't there. This effect is caused by gases in the atmosphere that are
transparent in visual light and opaque in infrared light. Mainly water vapour
(with short term effects) and CO₂ (with complex long-term lifecycles).

We have increased the amount of CO₂ dramatically in the last 100 years - from
320 to 420 (by 30%) in the last 60 years alone. We have seen that Earth is
significantly heating up. CO₂ pollution is coming from burning fossile fuels -
like coal (C) or gas (CH4).

We use the energy coming from there for global wealth, so we can't just stop it.
