From the previous post, the problem becomes obvious. While with traditional
combustion engines, the amount of kilometers is the most destructive part for
our environment, the new electrified vehicles have batteries. And they cause the
most damage while they are produced. That means many cars standing around is a
highly inefficient way to use such a resource. Even more so with battery-driven
cars.

There are already some approaches:

- Using the battery while the car is standing to store e.g. solar energy
  produced by a building roof for the night. That seems interesting at the first
  glance, but unflexible in the long run.

- Recycling batteries gives them a slightly better eco-balance, but it doesn't
  cover enough.

- The only sustainable solution is a change in our mindset. Why do we have to
  own cars? Why don't we share them? Why are we willing to stay in traffic jams
  day-in and day-out?
