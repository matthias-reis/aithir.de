It's getting more esoteric now. This part forms the perfect technobabble for
space story essentials like anti-gravity and FTL travel.

Next to the space dimensions, there are also three gravitational dimensions,
that our senses and brains can't realize. Our existence incorporates two of
these dimensions. We're living on a gravitational plane.

Only on this plane, a meter is actually a meter and a kilogram is a kilogram.
And more importantly, lightspeed and the gravitational constant are what they
are. You move to another layer and things are different.

In the early days, after the theory had been postulated, people found out that a
certain geometry of force fields could form a tube or a portal that allows
switching to higher or lower gravity layers.

That made it possible to use the different perspectives over there and travel
faster - even faster than light.

In some future chapters, I go into more detail on where that went.
