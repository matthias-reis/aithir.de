"What's the matter with you, Ruben?", she said angrily. "Another animal? You
know that we don't have the resources to feed animals."

Ruben and his gang were strong and formed an effective force in the defence

side of the cage. She saw a red eye staring at her from the inside and above
that, an ugly, rounded horn came out of its forehead. It smelled her with a
deranged nose and moved swiftly towards the slot. Juliette was startled and
recoiled a step or two. Afraid of the light coming through, the creature crept
away out of sight.

"What kind of prank is this?", she asked.
