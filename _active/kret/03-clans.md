The Kret, my own invention of an alien civilization, have one characteristic
difference from us. They live in Clans called "**Arras**". Arras are their only
social grouping. They don't have countries or borders, they don't have the
concept of cities as we know them.

These clans are comparable to large families of 30 to 70 members. The Kret in an
Arra are not necessarily all related, yet they are tightly connected. Children
are raised and educated together, old people are taken care of.

All of them live in the same huge building or rather structure, which they also
call "**Arra**". It has a large debating and leisure hall called "**Sune**" as
well as a similarly huge dining room called "**Hol**".

The families are equally led and represented by one matriarch and one patriarch.

Single persons don't have similar importance, weight or rights as in our world.
Neither have regions, companies or other social structures.
