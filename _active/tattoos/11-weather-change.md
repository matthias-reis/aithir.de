Lucy didn't dare to move. She was amazed by the art around her and by the
caracal, the most beautiful creature she had ever seen in the digital world. But
she also was paralyzed and afraid. Would it attack her? Was this some shooter
game where she came without a weapon?

But the cat moved on. Strode past her with a proud look in its eyes and gave her
a slight touch along the way. She continued her climb.

About a storey away, she caught a glimpse beyond the leaves of the tree into the
sky. It turned into a dark grey and it began to rain slightly. Then she noticed
that also the leaves themselves had shifted colours. The season was changing. It
was autumn now, but that was no reason to give up.

When it started to snow big, chunky snowflakes, she saw another iconic creature.
It was a raven shimmering in black and violet. That bird also had cyber
applications and mechanical parts. It even wore metal eyeglasses.

And it started to talk.
