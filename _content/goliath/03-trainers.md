There were more trainers than creators, especially after the first construction
phase was finished.

The group of trainers was very diverse and came from disciplines like
psychology, education, science and media next to a bunch of the best data
scientists in the world.

In the first training phase, they had two duties:

Firstly, they gathered and filtered important data from the world's public
internet, libraries and news platforms. As said, Goliath was completely
decoupled from the web for security reasons. The team was responsible to feed
the correct and unbiased data - most likely the most important and risky part of
the whole project.

Secondly, together with some architects from the creators' team, they built up
the core neural network and the language processing system from scratch.

After three more months, Goliath could speak, read and understand our language
and had basic Wikipedia-level knowledge about the world.
