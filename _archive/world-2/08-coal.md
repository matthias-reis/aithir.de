I had to change my publishing schedule a bit for a pressing topic: Coal! Coal is
currently the dirtiest of all energy sources. Therefore it's obvious that so
many people fight against sacrificing whole villages like Lützerath for lignite
open-cast mining.

So I researched some figures. Germany is worldwide number one in lignite
mining - in absolute numbers, not per capita - 10% more than number two, China.
In 2018, an equivalent of 500 Million t CO₂ or expressed in
[energy budget](/storylines/world-2/04-dimensions) 404% (yes, that is four times
the annual budget for coal alone). But a part of it is also exported and
consumed by people outside Germany. If we spread the coal throughout all of the
European population, it would still be 75% of a persons budget.

To make it even more tangible: Every single year more in that technology, costs
us 2 years of budget before 2050. Firing with full power till 2030 therefore
means being fully carbon neutral 14 years earlier. That is 2036. Very realistic,
right?
