The tree and the area were constantly changing. Lucy particularly noticed that
when she stepped outside the raven's tree house. It was dark. The tree was lit
by some Japanese lanterns and thousands of small lights that presumably came
from all those sleeping semi-cyborg inhabitants - yet another iconic photo she
couldn't take.

The black bird showed her the way as they climbed even further to the top of the
crown. And finally, she had reached a plateau at the top and could have a look
outside the roof of leaves.

"Hello, Lucy", another darker and calmer voice said. A huge barn owl sat next to
her, the large moon in its back. "You are this year's winner. Is it what you
expected".

"Oh, it's so much more", she said. So sad that I can't take shots.

"Mmh. I might have a surprise for you", was the old owl's answer.

Then the dawn broke, the night ended. Suddenly all the leaves fell, millions of
cherry blossom buds opened and turned the tree into a pink miracle.
