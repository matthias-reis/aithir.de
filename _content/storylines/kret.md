Aliens have always been the icing on the science fiction cake.

When I was sixteen, I started imagining extraterrestrial worlds. Partly to
understand our own world better. I called my first alien race "The Kret". The
world building went deep into details. During the next weeks, I'll continue
posting some of them.

The Kret have a lot of similarities with the humans. Reasonable explanations
will be provided for that aspect. However, their society and existence differ
drastically from ours. But let's go through the bare facts first.

My aliens live on an earth-like planet called Kret, that orbits the star Rana or
Delta Eridani within its habitable zone. Rana is about 30 Ly away from earth. My
choice for that system took me weeks at that time. Particularly it was
pre-internet and before the discovery of exoplanets. Today, we have proof of
thousands of planets in almost every star system, but not in that one.

## The Planet

The planet **Kret** is slightly smaller than Earth. Also, gravity is lower.
That's why the Kret themselves are on average a bit taller than humans.

The surface of the planet consists of 75% ocean. The 25% rest form a single,
contiguous continent. The Kret all live along the west coast west of a large,
long mountain chain. There are only a bunch of settlements on the other side of
the continent.

The mountain range is the source of many big rivers, that flow into the sea
after going through five vast deltas. Most of the 200 million inhabitants live
in that region in smaller settlements till up to larger city-esque areas.

All rivers are connected through artificial channels with each other and form a
widespread system of transport ways that made the Kret society prosper.

## The Kret

The Kret have one characteristic difference from us. They live in Clans called
"**Arras**". Arras are their only social grouping. They don't have countries or
borders, they don't have the concept of cities as we know them.

These clans are comparable to large families of 30 to 70 members. The Kret in an
Arra are not necessarily all related, yet they are tightly connected. Children
are raised and educated together, old people are taken care of.

All of them live in the same huge building or rather structure, which they also
call "**Arra**". It has a large debating and leisure hall called "**Sune**" as
well as a similarly huge dining room called "**Hol**".

The families are equally led and represented by one matriarch and one patriarch.

Single persons don't have similar importance, weight or rights as in our world.
Neither have regions, companies or other social structures.

As mentioned, the Kret are astonishingly (or let's say suspiciously) similar to
us humans. They could even walk through Stockholm or Hamburg without being
noticed.

However, they are slightly larger - about 1.89 m on average. This could be
related to the lower gravity of planet Kret. Men often don't have any top hair
and no beards. Women have dark and short hair.

After the first contact, scientists could dive deeper into that phenomenon and
found similar DNA, but encountered a deviation in the genetic lines that date
back to about 100,000 years. So all differences can be explained by the
different environments and a small original genetic pool.

On the planet, they found terrestrial genetic profiles based on DNA in plants
and animals, but they also came across a second line of plants with very unique
biology.

## The Kret Society

We know that the Kret are physically very similar to us and that they
genetically have a 100.000-year-old history. But they have missed some of the
tipping points of social development, that had led to this explosive exponential
growth of us humans.

Studies from sociologists point to their social relations and the lack of larger
entities that would foster such massive infrastructural efforts needed for
exponential development.

All other aspects of their life point to a culturally rich history that dates
back to civilizations at least twice as old as the first human ones. Especially
there are also no signs of large-scale disruptions like wars or pandemics.

Their craftsmanship and their understanding of arts for example are way ahead of
ours. Their knowledge and capabilities in the field of mechanics and their
insights into mathematics are extraordinary.

There is a strong hierarchy of social status within the arras, the Kret
families. But the system is not static. Families can rise and fall in their
reputation.

Additionally, it's getting more formal on the top, because there has to be a
committee that organizes and monitors global streams and development.

On Kret, there are nine high families, the so-called "**Arram Sul**", who
discuss and tackle these global issues. Each of the nine again has nine allied
families called "**Arram Mas**".

Each Arram Sul appoints four ambassadors, the "**Kala**". Together with the
matriarchs and the patriarchs of the high families, they form a council of 54
representatives called "**Kalam Mas**". This council could be seen as the world
government. It has an appointed moderator but there is no single leader.

The society of the Kret doesn't have a legislative power. As for all other parts
of their life, everyday rules are made within the family clans, the Arras.

Instead, they have a code of conduct, a rulebook that is over 5000 years old. It
is called "**Kanota Parchala**" and contains 1296 hard rules by which every Kret
citizen including the high members of the Karam Mas has to live.

The rules are continuously enforced by a caste of judges and therefore turn into
practical and modern interpretations.

There is also a second book, the "**Kanota Posa**", that describes the structure
of the Kret society and terms like property, ownership, heritage, consent and
decision making as well as the family structures.

As previously described, the life of all Kret is taking place inside their
Arras, their families. However, there is one caste that lives outside these
structures. The judges or in the Kret language, the "**Kane**" (singular
**Kano**).

Kane enjoy a high reputation within all ranks and hierarchies of the Kret
society. They are completely neutral and don't interfere in any way with the
daily business of Arras. They monitor each other with a complex system of
overlapping responsibilities and territories. So corruption exists but its
countermeasures are strong.

Next to the judges themselves, there is a full administrative infrastructure
that takes care of their supply of daily goods, organizational tasks and even
entertainment. The caste of the Kane is a world on its own.

Once a month there is a conference where the high council Kalam Mas and the
supreme judges (Kane Kane) come together for a mutual exchange.

## Observers

The human expedition was planned for a lifetime commitment. Observing and
studying a new species was the ultimate adventure that you could embark on in
Earth's 23rd century.

But it would not be a job in isolation and deprivations like many other
scientific expeditions. The team was huge. About 200 people were on the space
station that circled planet Kret.

There were all kinds of disciplines involved. From microbiologists to
theologists.

Besides the station in Kret's orbit, there also was a cloaked outpost on the
planet that mainly hosted relay technology for small robots. They called them
"The Bugs". They were only around 1 cm large but equipped with cameras,
microphones, other sensors and mainly an intelligence that could take autonomous
decisions.

First goal: Don't get caught! Second goal: Record and filter as much relevant
information as possible.

The team on the space station had a lot of material to explore.
