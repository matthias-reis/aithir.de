"I have been saved. I woke up in a hospital somewhere in Vietnam. Our ship sank
and all my colleagues died. And I had this strange dream that day. Or was it a
dream? I really don't know anymore."

After Mr Hanaku stopped his twenty-minute tale, the pub in Inningham, Middle
England fell silent. Probably for the first time ever, you couldn't hear a
sound. The dart players had stopped playing and all the other guests had stopped
eating and drinking and talking. Just the muted TV monitors showed flickering
images of some Premier League game. Actually there was also no other movement in
the room.

Well, at least for thirty seconds.

"Bartender?", yelled a Scottish guy. "Another whisky. I need a strong one after
that story".

And everything went back to normal. And Mr Hanko sank into his chair and smiled
slightly.

This has been the story of my right arm. The left one is still not finished. So
that story will be told on another day.
