In this series, I've collected facts and figures about our transport system and
possible alternatives. Cars as we know them are not the future. Flying and
moving goods around contributes to the bad reputation of that sector. So what
could sustainable transport look like?

For the daily moves, everyone will have a combination of options. None of them
includes owning a car. You call your vehicle when you need it and some seconds
later it stands in front of your door. It snaps into efficient convoy flows and
on long-distance trips, you switch to comfortable high-speed trains.

Sometimes, people still take flights, but usually only transcontinental. But the
planes will be powered by hydrogen.

And finally, all the goods of the world economy will travel slowly with almost
zero energy ships powered by wind and sunlight.

The only problem is that nobody wants to give up on comfort. No one wants to
take a step back. But unfortunately, we will have to take a step back now to
make some comfortable leaps forward in the future.
