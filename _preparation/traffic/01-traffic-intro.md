During Corona, many of us were bound to our homes. From time to time, we had to
move our muscles somehow. What I did was go out for walks. Because we also moved
into another district, everything was new and had to be discovered.

By the end of the lockdown, we knew all of the streets and alleys and secret
green pathways of our hood. Funnily we didn't know any of the shops, pubs and
restaurants around us, because they were closed.

But there is one depressing view that follows you when you go through the
streets of a city. Millions of parking cars. Gigantic immobile unneeded
mountains of metal standing around. Some of them are three times as large as
others. Their design cries "Attention, the boss is now on the road".

Ever since I can't get this picture out of my head again. Some cars are on the
road again. But still, any parking space is filled with such a tin man.

So why are we doing this to ourselves?
