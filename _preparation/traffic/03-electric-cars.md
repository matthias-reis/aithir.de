    title: German TüV on efficiency degrees of drives
---

The problem with classic cars powered by petrol for the environment is obvious.
For every 100 km, in an average Diesel, you spend 1% of your budget. So after
10,000 km your whole annual CO₂ budget is blown into the air.

Also, cars with combustion engines are incredibly inefficient. They use only 20%
of it efficiently on average. The rest is heat. Fuel Cells are at about 30% and
pure EVs are 64% efficient.

But EVs carry another problem: their batteries. The production also uses energy.
A lot. And it uses resources that are not mined sustainably at the moment. So
also EVs carry their burden. Probably even similar in size - breaking even after
about 100,000 km.

So the only sustainable way out is to drive less or more efficiently. And
throughout the rest of this series, I'd like to dive away from these facts, that
most of us already know. I rather want to explore other possibilities and models
and look a bit into a possible future.
