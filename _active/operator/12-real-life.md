Three weeks had passed since the heist. Although the first call with Hugo and
Adele was heartwarming and tears were flowing, Hana felt a change. They barely
worked together and they met in their real Avatars. At the same time, they were
closer and more distant to each other. Hana decided that it was time to do
something. She took the train to Hamburg.

She crushed somewhere in the pylons in one of the abandoned rooms near Hugo's
place. On the second night, she sat in a bar with him.

"Adele did not take it so well", he started the conversation. "Last week, we
broke up."

Hana was devastated. "Why didn't you tell me? Should I go and talk to her?"

"I think, you should give her some time."

They didn't say much more that night, just sitting in front of their cocktails
and staring at the opposite wall.

But Hana had to try. On the next morning, she visited Adele and had a long talk.
Adele wasn't used to that shit. She wasn't made for risky actions on the verge
of legality, for their life.

And then, also Hana recognized that it takes a while to heal the wounds and took
the train back to Prague.
