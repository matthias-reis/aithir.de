# / The story is mainly about a male designer called Hugo.
# / Girlfriend Adele (from Victor Hugo's wife Adele Foucher)
# In cyberspace, he's called "2055" - a transscription of Boss - which itself is an association with Hugo Boss, which is considered pretty old school and retro these days.
# / He lives on the Pylon. One of the abandoned hotel constructs on top of the former koehlbrandbridge pylons.
# He freelances on projects in the mesh.
# / And he works closely together with a tchech cyberlady called R00t.
# / While he never met her in real life, they form a pretty good tandem. She is the developer.
# She wouldn't call herself a Hacker, because she's creating rather than destroying.
# For her it's the differnce between an composer and an interpreter of music.
# ---
# Next to the normal freelance assignments, that take a small fraction of time but give them enough to survive, they also do gigs in the Mesh.
# They're between art and underground guerilla projects.
# And they are very good and quite famous.
# But this also attracts dark figures rising from the darknet
