I'd like to start a new posting series that I call "**World 2**". It's all about
the Seldon'esque crisis we're facing at the moment. The climate catastrophe. I'd
especially like to go into three different streams:

- **Transport**: Even besides its damage potential to the world climate (and
  this includes traditional cars and EVs), owning and driving so many cars harms
  us in many other ways. So it's worth a look on its own.

- **Diet and agriculture**: Food and food production are one of the big columns
  of reasons for the climate crisis. Everyone knows that. But it's also the
  hardest to give up.

- **Energy production**: Another topic with hundreds of side effects. We wage
  wars and fraternize with despots to get resources to produce energy. And we're
  ahead of another round of exploitation of the African continent.
