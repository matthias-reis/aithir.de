The aspect of respecting animal rights is the most important part of veganism.
Two simple narratives describe the situation best. Let's call it cat/cow
according to the Yoga position.

If you've ever lived with a pet, e.g. a cat, you automatically get to know their
character. I believe there is no way to unsee that the animal has a personality
that must be protected. They're a friend. They depend on you, speak in their own
language with you and you understand most of it. They express thoughts, feelings
and needs.

If you've ever looked into the processes in a slaughterhouse (I recommend the
documentary "Cowspiracy" for a start), you immediately know that it is wrong
what's happening there. It will be impossible for many people to accept these
conditions just for a steak.

Even without written law, this will become clear. Animal Rights are not up for
discussion. There will be cases where it doesn't seem that obvious. So it's also
very simple to draw the line. Just include all animals.
