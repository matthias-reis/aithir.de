          Initially, this story was formed by two ideas: How would we approach
          the topic of creating an AGI, a generel artificial intelligence. And
          why don&apos;t we let it fight against some nasty aliens. The movie
          Cowboys vs. Aliens came to my mind and the story was born. Also the
          story arc of splitting into two different and presumably independent
          parts was clear to me from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ideation phase happened way before Chat GPT and Large Language
          Models took off. I had imagined the scenario 20 or 30 years in the
          future. So the reality was faster this time.
