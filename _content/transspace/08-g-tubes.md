Two of the participants in the Enclave project, **Charles Frempton**, an
engineer and **Janice De Jong**, a data scientist, have worked on the
possibility to enter deeper layers of the gravitational dimensions. This
technology was considered the basis for Faster Than Light travel.

The problem had to be solved with raw computing power. It took them 2 years
alone to find a geometric field that theoretically could have worked. Toward the
end, they could present the first prototype, that could generate a small 80 cm
diameter portal to a 25 times deeper gravitational layer - making everything 25
times faster than in our world without additional effort.

Later on, Frempton created a probe that fitted through the hole. It made it to
the moon in 42 minutes using normal ionbic propulsion.

They called that tube geometry "G25" but that was not the end. Over the years,
other solutions have been found. The current maximum is G180k.
