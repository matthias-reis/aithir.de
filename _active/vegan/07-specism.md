Going vegan has three pillars. In the last episodes, we have covered some ground
on one of them - sustainability and climate protection. In the next posts, I'd
also dive into the other aspects. So let's start with specism and animal rights.

Specism in its clearest form is when you love your little designer dog and at
the same time have fur around your neck from one of its ancestors/siblings. But
it's more than that.

It's baked (wrong word, I know, butchered would be better) even into the
language. In English, you differentiate between cow and beef, calf and veal, pig
and pork.

Also, meat is an abstraction. A ridiculous argument against vegans is that they
substitute meat with "identically looking alternatives", while a sausage looks
nothing at all like the original. With the abstraction, it's wiped from our
conscious mind.

People even think that organic meat - where animals have 30 cm more space would
be less cruel. No. Someone cuts these throats as well in the end.
