Oscar van Dyk was one of the experts in the team of Carla Ruiz. They were
responsible for the artefacts they called octahedra based on their form. There
were four parts, almost identical and slightly imperfect. They were almost
transparent except for a slight shimmer in different wavelengths.

Sometimes Oscar leaves his labs to visit lectures on campus. Today, it was about
Giovanni Battista Belzoni, an archaeologist, who discovered the entrance to the
Chephren pyramid in Gizeh.

Oscar almost fell from his chair as he listened to the monotonous listing of the
pyramid's parameters. Tilt angle 53.16°, said the professor. That was the same
value as in the octahedra. A perfect octahedron should have 54.73°. And if you
put two pyramids together, you get an octahedron.

Oscar jumped off his seat. The whole auditorium looked at him. He ran out and
straight back to the team's institute.

"Chephren", he shouted into the room. "The Chephren pyramid, that's where we
find the next piece."
