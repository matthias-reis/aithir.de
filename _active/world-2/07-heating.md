We seem to have usable solutions for electricity and transport, as it seems. But
the third column, heating your living room, seems to be the biggest challenge
for carbon neutrality. There are a lot of buildings with a lot of shitty
technology built in. So the problem is highly decentral.

The heating sector contributes 15% to greenhouse emissions. That translates to
75% of our budget. At the moment, the share of energy sources is

- 41 % gas
- 17% oil
- 18% electricity
- 8% district heating
- 15% renewable energy

This sums up to about 70% of fossile energy sources. The renewable part mainly
comes from wood, which also doesn't scale well.

There are alternatives. Geothermal heat pumps will have to be introduced
wherever possible and heat exchangers must become standard.

The current technology is based on water as a carrier, which makes it difficult
to exchange it with more intelligent air conditioning systems. The major
turnover though must come through savings and better insulation.
