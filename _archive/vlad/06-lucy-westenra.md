The weather on this trip was not better than my previous experience. But this
time I had company. Maxim was a pleasant travel partner and throughout the days,
we could even work on some of the material. After three weeks, we arrived at the
biggest registry of the region in Vienna. And we had a plan on how to start the
search.

Only two hours later, we had reasonable douts about our past findings. Vlad, the
son was the devil, not the father. The father Vlad II. only made the mistake to
sell his son in young age to a sultan and somehow caused all this misery.

Another fact awakened our interest. Lucy Westenra appeared in several reports in
the archive and also in Bram Stokers novel. Many others seem to be fictional.
Westenra was a registered hermetic on level 6. She either seemed to play the
role of a conspirator or a seduced victim. The sources were at that point still
unclear. So we had material to speculate while staying over night.

It was clear that we needed more time.
