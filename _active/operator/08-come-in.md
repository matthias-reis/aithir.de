The day of the heist. `B055` and `R00t` prepared themselves. They chose flies as
their Avatars. `R00t` once came up with that mod. Actually, avatars have to be
at least 1 unit in height. For today's purpose, a little piece of nothing that
could defy virtual gravity was a perfect fit.

Security in the Mesh is a two-fold topic. There are the virtual mechanics. A
wall simply can't be passed easily and all objects have a protocoled relation
towards each other. You can't mess up with those things that easily on the code
level for example. Important stuff is additionally secured by crypto, the very
good ones were encrypted on quantum computing level.

The Credit Cayman vault had both. But as flies, most of the mechanical
obstacles, entrance, elevators, door locks, were not an obstacle. All the others
were a task for `R00t`'s AI, that she called Kit. `R00t` Kit, a funny pun only
she and a handful of really old hackers understood.

Only minutes later they stood in front of the safe.
