A view of my imagined #multiverse simplified through the looking glass of
popular science comes with 9 dimensions.

Three of them are the space dimensions - basically the ones we know. Three more
are time dimensions. One of them is the linear time that we live in. The others
are splitting up the world into a multiverse of possibilities.

The last three are bound to gravity. Our existence is connected to two of these
grav dimensions, so we live on a gravitational plane.

Especially with the gravitational part of the theory, there are immediate and
reasonable applications for daily life like the possibility to create ad-hoc
force fields.

But there is also the possibility to access a higher plateau than the one we
live in, which changes some relations between mass and distance and allows
moving faster than light.

My next related post will dive a bit deeper into the details.
