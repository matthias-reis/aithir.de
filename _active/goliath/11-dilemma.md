This decision was hard. The question was: Was it risky to set the AI free? Was
it more dangerous than the threat from the aliens?

The aliens were merciless. They still killed people one after the other and they
killed humanity along the way. They made the world change by getting into
people's minds. The world would never be the same again unless a miracle occurs.

The AI was a creation of us. It seemed to have god-like powers but it never
showed tendencies to abuse that power. Was it because Goliath knew its
boundaries? Its prison? Could there be some inner rage because we imprisoned it?

But in the end, the decision was clear and unanimous among the members of the UN
delegation that took care.

Four weeks after the first alien foray of death, Goliath was granted access to
the whole Internet infrastructure.

Goliath had a mission, but it also was set free.
