It is July 1905. I am at the hermetic high court in London and it is right
before the start of the trial against the famous Bram Stoker. I just made my
last observation regarding the case today, here at the courthouse.

Throughout the last arduous months, I have collected all the details of two
cases, the one that is on trial today, Bram Stoker against the Hermetic society
and the quite disruptive case of Vlad, the Impaler. I've travelled through the
darkest regions of Europe and got buried under tons of bureaucratic reports and
unreadable paperwork.

I have uncovered all relations between Stoker's novel and the real events and
all its witnesses and collaborators. Except for one name. Jonathan Harker, the
solicitor in the novel. And today, I have found out that it is the name of Bram
Stoker's barrister. I saw him here in the halls and it is very likely, that Bram
Stoker based the fictional character on the real one. Last mystery solved.

"Camil Constantin?", the announcer called out. It's my turn.
